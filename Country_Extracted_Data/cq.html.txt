Northern_Mariana_Islands



  Background:
  Under US administration as part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific, the people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in the 1970s not to seek independence but instead to forge closer links with the US. Negotiations for territorial status began in 1972. A covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the US was approved in
  1975, and came into force on 24 March 1976. A new government and constitution went into effect in 1978.
