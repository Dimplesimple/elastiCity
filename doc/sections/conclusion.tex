We aim to create a social travel planning workflow service that can guide users in making better travel decisions on a city basis. Using elasticsearch and a user facing, response UI, we intend to create a reasonably useable service that can serve as a proof of concept for the usage of elasticsearch in social applications and assist in decision making - in this case for a vacation.
