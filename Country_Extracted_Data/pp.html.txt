Papua_New_Guinea



  Background:
  The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK (south) in 1885. The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902, which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to administer the combined areas until independence in 1975. A nine-year
  secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in 1997 after claiming some 20,000 lives.

  People_-_note:
  the indigenous population of Papua New Guinea is one of the most heterogeneous in the world; PNG has several thousand separate communities, most with only a few hundred people; divided by language, customs, and tradition, some of these communities have engaged in low-scale tribal conflict with their neighbors for millennia; the advent of modern
  weapons and modern migrants into urban areas has greatly magnified the impact of this lawlessness
