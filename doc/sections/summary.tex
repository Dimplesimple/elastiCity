Traveling is fun, but proper planning is difficult. A traveler interested in going to a city would start their search with background information about the city, generally on a structured site like Wikipedia. A background query is usually followed by a simple google search of the city, which usually yields unstructured reviews and forum posts. The traveler could then refine the search based on categories of interests. Categories can include interests particular to the traveler (cycling, beers, etc.) or attractions the user knows a-priori are found at that city (beach, mountain, memorial, monument). Combined with a weather based assessment of the feasibility of visiting the city, a traveler aims to put together an action plan using a search engine like google (for open ended queries) combined with wikipedia (for background knowledge about the location). However, we have found a significant shortcoming in this workflow, as it fails to integrate any aspect of social ``buzz'' surrounding the location potentially detrimental in helping the user figure out what other users around the globe found to do in that destination and how they enjoyed it.
