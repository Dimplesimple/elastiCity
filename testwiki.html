<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Do</h2><br />London is a huge city, so all individual listings should be in the appropriate
district articles.
To make the most of the citys tremendous cultural offerings (performing arts,
museums, exhibitions, clubs, eateries and numerous others), visitors will do
well to pick up a copy of a cultural magazine like Time_Out_London (available
at most corner shops and newsagents) which gives detailed information and
critiques on whats around town including show times and current attractions.
Their website also has major shows listed and there is also an iPhone/iPod app
available - though these tend to not be as detailed as the print version.
    * Take a walk through Londons Royal Parks. A good walk would start at
      Paddington station, and head through Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green
      Park (passing Buckingham Palace) and St James Park before crossing
      Trafalgar Square and the River Thames to the South_Bank and Waterloo
      Station. At a strolling pace this walk would take half a day, with plenty
      of places to stop, sit, drink, eat en-route. A good pictorial description
      of this walk can be found online at Trips_By_Trains_Royal_Parks_Walk.
    * Live Music London is one of the best cities in the world for concerts,
      spanning from new musical trends to well known bands. Popular classical
      concerts at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square.
          o Between huge concert facilities and small pubs, there are hundreds
            of venues that organise and promote live music every week. Many
            concerts, especially in smaller or less known places are free, so
            there is plenty of choice even for tourists on a budget. London has
            long been a launchpad for alternative movements, from the mods of
            the 60s, punks of the 70s, new romantics of the 80s, the britpop
            scene of the 90s and in recent years the indie rock movement
            spearheaded by The Libertines and their ilk. It has one of the
            worlds most lively live music scenes: any band heading a British,
            European or World tour will play London, not to mention the local
            talent.
          o Londons Music Scene is incredibly diverse, covering all genres of
            music from electro-jazz to death-metal, and all sizes of bands,
            from the U2s and Rolling Stones of the world to one man bands who
            disband after their first gig.
          o This diversity is reflected in prices. As a rough guide: Â£20+ for
            top 40 bands in arena sized venues, Â£10+ for established bands
            in mid sized venues, Â£6+ for up and coming bands and club nights
            in smaller venues, Â£5- for start up bands in bars and pubs. London
            has hundreds of venues spread out over the city and the best way to
            know whats going on where is to browse on-line ticket agencies and
            music_magazines_gig_directories. One of the easiest to use and
            most comprehensive listings websites is "LONDONEARS".
          o However, there are a few areas which have higher concentrations of
            pubs and venues than others. Kilburn is situated in North West
            London. Its long been known as an Irish area, and though their
            numbers have somewhat declined any visit to a local pub will show
            their influence remains today. Kilburns important venue is The
            Good Ship. Due to its inclusive policies and fair payment
            system, The Good Ship is a favourite place for young aspiring bands
            to try to get a foot off the ground. Good for those who would like
            to see bands "before they were big", who appreciate Â£5 entrance
            fees, good beer and friendly staff.
    * Theatre The West End, especially the areas concentrated around Leicester
      Square, Covent Garden, Shaftesbury Avenue and Haymarket, is one of the
      worlds premier destinations for theatre, including musical theatre.
          o Covent Garden has the only Actor sponsored school in the city
            called the Actors Centre  which also gave way to the London
            Acting Network , a London acting community support group. In
            the centre of Leicester Square there is an official half-price TKTS
            booth.
          o For up-to-date listings check the official London_theatreland_site.
          o The South Bank is another area well-known for world class theatre,
            and is home to both the National Theatre and the Globe Theatre, the
            latter of which is Londons only thatched building and an
            attraction in itself. Each Globe performance has over 700 tickets
            priced at Â£5. Londons theatre scene outside of these two main
            districts is known as "the Fringe". There are tour companies
            worldwide that take travellers to see London theatre. These
            companies sell themselves on being able to deliver unique and
            behind-the-scenes access to some of the worlds greatest theatres.
    * Watch a movie As well as the world-famous blockbuster cinemas in the West
      End, London has a large number of superb art house cinemas. In the summer
      months, there are often outdoor screenings at various venues, such as
      Somerset House and in some of the large parks.
    * Watch football Take in a home match of one of the citys 15+ professional
      football clubs for a true experience of a lifetime as you see the passion
      of the "Worlds Game" in its mother country.
          o London often has six clubs in the top Premier League: Arsenal,
            Chelsea, Fulham, Queens Park Rangers (QPR), Tottenham Hotspur, and
            West Ham United. A level down, in the Football League Championship,
            finds Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace, and Millwall. Five other
            clubs are in lower levels of the professional league
            systemâBrentford and Leyton Orient in Football League One; and
            AFC Wimbledon, Barnet and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in Football
            League Two. Many of the bigger clubs will require booking in
            advance, sometimes many months ahead, but smaller clubs allow you
            to simply turn up on match day and pay at the gate. You will be
            able to find a ticket to a quality football match on any Saturday
            during the season.
    * Open_House_London_Weekend lets you explore many of the citys most
      interesting buildings during the London Open House Weekend - usually held
      on the third weekend of September. During this single weekend, several
      hundred buildings which are not normally open to the public are opened
      up. See website for details of buildings opening in any given year - some
      buildings have to be pre-booked in advance - book early for the popular
      ones!
    * Winter Skating. London has a number of outdoor ice rinks that open in the
      winter months. Considered by some to be somewhat overpriced and
      overcrowded, they nonetheless have multiplied in recent years, easing
      congestion and increasing competition. Most charge from Â£10-12 (adults)
      for an hour on the ice, including skate hire. See the district articles
      for the City_of_London, East_End and Leicester_Square.
    * Summer Skating. In summer (and also in winter, for the more dedicated)
      there is also a thriving roller skating (on inline and traditional "quad"
      skates) scene in London, catering to many disciplines including street
      hockey, freestyle slalom, dance, general recreational skating (including
      three weekly marshalled group street skates) and speed skating. This
      mostly centres around Hyde Park (on the Serpentine Road) and Kensington
      Gardens (by the Albert Memorial). See the district articles for Mayfair-
      Marylebone and South_West_London.
    * Do-it-yourself bus tour If you dont feel like splashing out on one of
      the commercial bus tours, you can make your own bus tour by buying an
      Oyster card and spending some time riding around London on the top deck
      of standard London buses. Of course you dont get the open air or the
      commentary, but the views are very similar. You will likely get lost but
      that is half the fun; if it worries you go for a commercial tour.
    * For a guided tour of London check out The_Literary_London_Walking_Tour -
      an interesting, informative and funny walk through London and its
      literary hotspots of the past and present. Meet local writers and poets
      and listen to them perform their works (Â£15 per person).
    * London Pub Quiz One of the most popular events on a Sunday thru Thursday
      evening is a British style pub quiz. You can find a local quiz at
      hundreds of pubs around London. For a comprehensive list and map of
      quizzes through out London check out Question_One,_The_real_social
      network. Entry fees vary, but are usually between Â£1-2 per person and
      teams can be from 2-8 people.
    * Discover Walks, 4 Coney Way London SW8 1LW, â +44 20 3514-0211, .
      Meet actual Londoners in addition to exploring major landmarks. Join a
      walk with locals who will "decode" the city with you, and also learn from
      an insider about local events and festivals, about where to shop, good
      places to eat or drink, secret places locals keep to themselves. Â  *
    * Photo tours and Portrait sessions, . By appointment, tours last from
      3.5 hours to several days. Instructional tours that combine hands-on
      learning of essential photographic techniques with guiding to, and
      commentary about, photogenic spots in London. Led by English-speaking
      photographers and instructors, these photos tours are open to all skill
      levels and interest. Portrait sessions are perfect to capture some unique
      moments in London. Conducted by professional photographers, these
      sessions are good for special occasions or just for the fun of it. From
      Â£245 per 90min session. From Â£160/half day; Â£240/full day. Â  *
</blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Buy</h2><br />Oxford Street December
Harrods
London is also one of the worlds most fashion conscious cities, which explains
the abundance of clothing shops from the flagship shops of Oxford_Street to the
tiny boutiques of Brick_Lane.
Though not particularly known for bargain shopping, nearly anything you could
possibly want to buy is available in London. In Central London, the main
shopping district is the West End (Bond St, Covent Garden, Oxford St and Regent
St). On Thursdays many West End stores close later than normal (19:00-20:00).
Remember that London is a massive city, and many of its suburbs qualify as
small cities in themselves with similar concentrations of chain stores that you
would find in the West End. Indeed, some Londoners never shop along Oxford
Street unless they absolutely have to - and eschew "shopping in town" in favour
of local malls. Again, because of the citys comprehensive public transport,
getting out to the suburbs is very easy and fast. You just have to know where
to look!
    * Oxford_Street. Main shopping street home to flagship branches of all the
      major British high street retailers in one go including Selfridges ,
      John Lewis  (includes a food hall), Marks &amp; Spencer  and
      other department stores. Really overcrowded and has pretty ordinary shops
      actually.
    * Regent_Street (between Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus). Includes
      such gems as Hamleys, considered to be Londons flagship toy store, on
      seven levels, and the London Apple Store.
    * Bond_Street. Some of the worlds most luxurious designer stores such as
      Cartier, D&amp;G, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuitton and Versace.
    * Tottenham_Court_Road. Contains some of the worlds most luxurious
      designer interior stores such as Heals, whilst the southern end is famous
      for its large concentration of hi-fi, computer and electronics stores.
    * Covent_Garden . Fashionable area home to quaint outlets and
      relatively expensive designer stores. Around Seven Dials chains include
      Adidas Originals, All Saints, Carhartt, Fred Perry, G Star Raw and
      Stussy. For shoes head for Neal St. Also the London Transport Museum
      whose gift shop has some of the best souvenirs in the city (old maps,
      vintage Tube posters, etc). But the vendors are now not allowed to sell
      merchandise with Union Jacks on. Sad.
    * Charing_Cross_Road (near Covent Garden). A book lovers haven! New,
      second-hand, antiquarian and specialist.
    * Soho . Offers alternative music and clothes. Now home to Chappell of Bond
      Sts historic music shop.
    * Camden_Town. Alternative clothing and other alternative shopping, popular
      with teenagers and young adults. Also nearby Camden Lock market. Has lots
      of really cool and affordable stuff but kind of gothish.
    * Chelsea. The Kings Road is noted for fashion, homeware and kids. On
      Wednesday many stores close late.
    * Knightsbridge. Department stores include the world famous Harrods 
      (includes a food hall) and Harvey Nichols. On Wednesday many stores close
      late.
    * Beauchamp Place.Shop where royalty and celebrities shop.One of the
      worlds most unique and famous streets. Over the years it has developed
      its strong reputation as one of Londonâs most fashionable and
      distinctive streets, housing some of the best known names in London
      fashion, interspersed with trendy restaurants, jewellers and speciality
      shops including the world famous trademark Fortuny , .
    * Westminster. Some of the worlds most famous shirts are made on Jermyn
      St. Savile Row is home to some of the worlds best mens bespoke tailors
      including Henry Poole, Gieves &amp; Hawkes, H. Huntsman &amp; Sons, Dege
      &amp; Skinner and many other.
    * Westfield. In Shepherds Bush and now Stratford. Hard to miss. Has
      designer shops in with the more affordable chain shops. Its the biggest
      shopping centre in Europe. Has lots of good places to eat. It can get
      very busy on weekends though. Has its own train station.
**** Markets *****
Borough (tube: London Bridge)  is a great (if expensive) food market,
offering fruit, veg, cheese, bread, meat, fish, and so on, much of it organic.
Th-Sa (best to go in the morning, since it gets unpleasantly crowded by around
11:00).
Old_Spitalfields_Market  is an excellent market for clothes from up-and-
coming designers, records, housewares, food, and all things trendy, it was once
the London fruit markets. Find it at 65 Brushfield St London E1 6AA (Straight
down Bell Lane past 66-68 and keep walking). Visit 66/68 Bell Lane nearby to
see a wealthy merchants house, rumor has it John Lennon once played on the roof
of this building with Yoko Ono. Also checkout Brick_Lane, Greenwich and
Portobello, .

**** Airports *****
Tax-free shops in airports are not strong in variety, prices are equal to
London, and they close rather early as well. Shop listings at airport web sites
can help to plan your tax-free (vs traditional) shopping. In the evening allow
extra half an hour as closing hours are not always strictly respected.
</blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Get around</h2><br />Transport maps
London is the home of the famous tube map, and TfL produce some excellent maps
to help you get around:
    * Tube_map
    * Tube_and_trains with Oyster card information
    * Bus_maps - if you know which borough youre in, these maps are very
      useful
    * River_buses - great if youre near the Thames
London has one of the most comprehensive public transport systems in the world.
Despite residents constant, and sometimes justified, grumbling about
unreliability, public transport is often the best option for getting anywhere
for visitors and residents alike.
In central London use a combination of the transport options listed below - and
check your map! In many cases you can easily walk from one place to another or
use the buses. Dont be a Londoner and only use the tube as a way of travelling
longer distances - youre here to see London - you cant see it underground!
Transport_for_London_(TfL) is a government organisation responsible for all
public transport. Their website contains maps plus an excellent journey
planner. They also offer a 24-hour travel information line, charged at premium
rate: â 0843 222 1234 (or text 60835) for suggestions on getting from A to B,
and for up to the minute information on how services are running. Fortunately
for visitors (and indeed residents) there is a single ticketing system, Oyster,
which enables travellers to switch between modes of transport on one ticket.
The main travel options in summary are:
Central London
    * By_tube_/_underground 11 colour-coded lines cover the central area and
      suburbs, run by TfL.
    * By_Docklands_Light_Railway_(DLR) Runs only in the east of the city,
      providing links with London City Airport, Canary Wharf/Docklands,
      Stratford (For Westfield Stratford City and the Olympic site) and
      Greenwich, privately run but part of TfLs network.
    * By_boat Commuter boats and pleasure cruises along the River Thames,
      privately run but part of TfLs network.
    * Airport_Express Rail services run to Heathrow, Gatwick, Southend,
      Stansted and Luton airports. The trains to Heathrow are privately
      operated and require a premium fare. The trains to the other airports are
      part of the UK rail network, but are beyond the TfL network, so Oyster is
      not valid.
Suburban London
    * By_tram_(Tramlink) A tram service that operates only in southern suburbs
      around Wimbledon and Croydon.
    * By_Overground Orange-coloured lines circling the northern suburbs;
      connecting Stratford (For Westfield Stratford City and the Olympic site)
      with Richmond Upon Thames. At Highbury and Islington it is possible to
      connect to Croydon and Crystal Palace in South London via the East End.
      There is also an interchange for Barking in East London at Gospal Oak and
      a line connecting Euston Station with Watford Junction in Hertfordshire.
      Another line runs from Willsden Junction in North West London to Clapham
      Junction in south via Shephards Bush (For Westfield). At Clapham you can
      connect to Brighton,Gatwick Airport, Southampton and other points south.
      Part of TfLs network.
    * By_National_Rail A complex network of suburban rail services, mostly
      running in the southern suburbs, but also connecting to some areas to the
      north. privately run and not part of the TfL network, although all
      operators now accept Oyster payments.
**** Oyster Card *****
Oyster Card in use
Oyster  is a contactless electronic smartcard run by Transport for London.
In general, Oyster is the more cost effective option than paper tickets if you
plan to be in London for any more than a couple of days, or if you intend to
make return visits to the city - the savings quickly recover the initial
purchase cost. You can buy an Oyster Card from any Tube station for a deposit
of Â£5 and load it with a 7 Day Travelcards. You can "charge up" an Oyster card
with electronic funds. This cash is then deducted according to where you
travel. The cost of a single trip using the Oyster card is considerably less
than buying a single paper ticket with cash. Prices vary depending on distance
travelled, whether by bus or tube, and on the time of day. You can also add
various electronic 1 week, 1 month and longer-period tickets onto the card, and
the card is simply validated each time you use it. The deposit is refundable if
you hand it in at the end of the trip, though if your stay is short your refund
will be reduced by Â£3. However, there is no expiry date on the Oyster Card or
any pay-as-you-go cr *on the card. If you have any pay-as-you-go cr *left
this will also be refunded. You will get refunds in cash only if you paid in
cash. Be prepared to give your signature on receipts or even show ID for
refunds over a few pounds.
*** Pay-as-you-go (PrePay) ****
You can charge up your Oyster card with electronic cash at any tube station
ticket machine or ticket desk (you can even use a cr *card to do this if
your cr *card has a PIN number) with Oyster pay-as-you-go, also known as
PrePay. This money is then deducted from your card each time you get on a
service. The fare is calculated based on your start and end points. Pay-as-you-
go is much cheaper than paying in cash for each journey. For instance, a cash
tube one way in Zone 1 is Â£4.50, while with an Oyster Card it costs Â£2.30.
Furthermore, it is impossible to pay a cash bus fare - the Oyster fare is
Â£1.50. If you are intending to do a lot of travelling in London then a day
travel card may be cheaper and offers a whole days free access on Londons
public transport. It will cost you Â£12.00 for anyone over the age of 15 and
for 15 and under you can but a travel card for Â£3.70. These can be purchased
at a post office or tube station. Oyster cards are also capped at a lower price
than the paper daily travel card.
The amount of PrePay deducted from your Oyster card in one day is capped - for
central London this is lower than the appropriate paper day ticket (day
Travelcard). For zone 1-2 (central London including everywhere inside the
Circle line and some places outside) this is Â£6.40 (There is no difference in
price cap between peak and off peak in central London).
On the tube, be sure to touch in and touch out again at the end of your
journey. If you forget to touch your Oyster card at the start and finish you
will be charged extra! This is usually a hefty charge of Â£7.20. This fine can
be disputed by calling TFL using the phone number on the back of the card. Just
quote your Oyster number and remember where you finished your journey.
Oyster also saves time getting onto buses. If you dont have an Oyster, you
must use a "contactless" bank card or a paper travelcard. You cannot pay cash
on London buses.
Buses operated under contract to London buses (thats most buses within the
M25) do NOT accept cash.
If you have a National Railcard, such as the 16-25 year old Railcard, you can
register this with your Oyster card at a Tube ticket office and then continue
to receive special discounts on your TFL travel. So for every journey on the
Underground/DLR/Overground you get 34% discount and also qualify for a daily
price cap. Do note the discount applies only during off-peak times.
*** Travelcards ****
A Travelcard may be loaded onto an Oyster card (not day tickets) or may be
purchased as a paper ticket.
    * Day Travelcard - Zones 1-6 - Anytime: Â£12
    * 7 Day Travelcard Zones 1-2 - Â£30.40 (2014 price)
    * Monthly Travelcard Zones 1-2 - Â£116.08 (2014 price)
    * Annual Travelcard Zones 1-2 - Â£1,216.00 (2014 price)
The above prices are Adult prices and only for Zones 1 &amp; 2. However, one-
day travelcards are only issed as zone 1-6 (changed in 2014). The "daily cap"
using Oyster is cheaper at Â£6.40 for zones 1 &amp; 2. For a more comprehensive
list of the prices visit the TFL website:
1 Day Travelcards 
7 Day, Monthly &amp; Annual Travelcards 
*** Travelcard season tickets ****
Weekly, monthly and longer-period Travelcard season tickets can be purchased at
all tube station ticket offices. These can be used on any tube, DLR, bus,
London Overground, National Rail or tram service. You have to select a range of
zones when you buy it, numbered 1-9. If you happen to travel outside the zone,
you can use PrePay (see above) to make up the difference. Note that they can
not be used on any Airport Express trains (Heathrow Express, Gatwick Express
and Stansted Express). However, a Zone 1-6 Travelcard can be used on the London
Underground (Piccadilly line) to/from Heathrow Airport. Notice a weekly
travelcard may be cheaper than PAYG Oyster card if you are looking to travel
extensively within London for more than five days in a week.
*** Tips ****
    * Touch the card against a yellow disc, prominently displayed on the entry
      and exit gates for the Tube (do not try to insert it into the slot!) and
      on buses and trams.
    * On the Docklands Light Railway, and on the Overground railway stations in
      the outlying parts of the city there are no entry or exit gates (except
      at interchanges with the Tube like Bank or Stratford), so you have to be
      sure to touch your Oyster card on the readers (which are clearly
      signposted) as you enter and leave. Failure to do this when you begin a
      journey is regarded as fare dodging (carrying a penalty fare or even a
      fine if you are caught). Equally, failing to touch out when you leave a
      station will result in you being overcharged for your journey, as the
      system will make a default deduction of Â£6.50 since it doesnt know
      which station you left at.
    * Theoretically you dont need to remove your Oyster card from your wallet
      or bag to do touch in/out - the card reader can work through a bag, but
      in reality you may need to take the card out to get it to work. Keep
      other contactless cards such as bank cards separate, as the fare might be
      deducted from them instead of your Oyster.
    * Be careful standing near the readers on some buses, they are often quite
      sensitive and may read your card from several centimetres away, even if
      you did not intend this.
    * If you keep your Oyster card in your wallet try not to sit on it as
      sometimes they will crack and stop working.
*** Validity ****
The following table summarises the validity of the different tickets you can
use on Oyster. For most tourists, tubes and buses are the only transport you
will use, but be aware that these tickets are not valid on any Rail trains to
any of Londons airports.
              Bus London      London     National Rail DLR Tram Airport Express
                  Underground Overground                        trains

    * Bus (and Tram) Passes are only available for periods of 7 days and
      longer.
    * Travelcards are valid only within the zones you buy.
    * Piccadilly line to Heathrow is a London Underground train, so PrePay and
      Travelcards are valid.
    * Airport Express trains are Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Express.
    * Travelcards are valid on Thameslink within London but if you are heading
      to Luton or Gatwick airports, you will need a ticket between the edge of
      your travelcard zone and the airport.
A reminder on the streets of London to "Look Right" when you cross the road
**** By foot *****
London is a surprisingly compact city, making it a walkers delight and often
being the quickest method of transport.
The city is incredibly well signposted so it is very easy to find your way
round by foot.
Because Britain drives on the left hand side of the road, for most foreign
visitors it can be all too easy to forget that traffic will come at you from
the opposite direction than you are used to when crossing a street - for this
reason remember to look right when you cross the road.
Particularly on Central Londons busiest streets, it is easy to spot native
Londoners as they are able to weave in and out of the large crowds at fast
speed. Refrain from walking slowly in tight spaces to avoid annoying any fast
walking people that may be trying to pass.
**** By Tube / Underground *****

General Tube etiquette
    * Beware of pickpockets. Ensure zips and backpacks are done up securely.
    * Drinking alcohol or smoking anywhere on the underground is illegal. Flash
      photography within stations is prohibited because it may interfere with
      fire detection systems.
    * Be careful at the ticket barrier of people coming up close behind you in
      an attempt to get through the barrier on your ticket. This isnt a huge
      problem, but it does happen.
    * Some platforms in Zone 1 have the words "Mind the Gap" written on the
      platform edge. When the train stops, the carriage doors will usually line
      up with this warning. Alternatively, train doors will also line up near
      the platform exits (not directly in front, but slightly off centre). You
      will notice Londoners walk fast down the platform and then randomly stop
      in a specific spot. This is also where train doors will open.
    * Stand behind the ""yellow line"" when a train approaches, even if
      Londoners do not. Ensure pushchairs are secured when the train is
      approaching/leaving a station (hold onto it) as the gusts of wind can
      suck pushchairs onto the Tube tracks.
Inter-personal etiquette:
Londoners live with continuous tourism in their city. Many are patient and
willing to help you if youre lost Underground, however the volume of
inconsiderate tourists who are ignorant about local customs can become
irritating. To avoid confrontations with busy travellers and angry Londoners,
you should follow the following unwritten rules:
    * When using the escalators, you must always stand on the right (as
      indicated on signage) as busy commuters walk down the left side of the
      escalator. If you stop on the left side, or have luggage/bags blocking
      the passage, you are likely to be confronted by an angry Londonder
      instructing you (loudly) to move.
    * You must always ""let people off the train before boarding"". When a
      train arrives, stand to the left or right of the door (not directly in
      front) and ensure your luggage/bags are not blocking the way for those
      disembarking. Londoners can get extremely irritable when tourists barge
      past them onto the train and will often make you wait for the passengers
      behind you to board before allowing you on the train.
    * Move down the cars if standing during busy periods. Do not crowd the
      doors (as you will likely be pushed down the car by those boarding) and
      do not stand as a group if there is limited room.
    * Have your Oyster card or ticket ready for the top of the escalators so
      not to obstruct barriers. It is important, especially during peak times,
      to be quick when touching in or touching out (Londoners can do it in
      around two seconds) -- hold your Oyster to the yellow scanning disk, keep
      looking down until the LED goes green and then proceed through quickly.
      Some barriers, such as those at non-commuter stations (e.g. Sloane
      Square), open slower than those at major interchanges (e.g. Victoria),
      where the barriers snap open rapidly.
    * Give up your seat to the elderly and those less able to stand, especially
      if the seat is reserved for such a purpose. This is indicated by a blue
      plaque with white writing.
    * Never try to board or leave a train when the door warning (a rapidly-
      repeating high pitch beep) is sounding. Many older trains are not fitted
      with sensors to detect if the doors are blocked and its all too easy to
      become stuck in the doors, although the train cannot start if the doors
      are still open. You will incur the wrath of tired and busy commuters.
    * When coming down the escalators to a platform, do not go through the
      first platform entrance you see and crowd one part of the concourse. Walk
      down the platform to an end, where there is more space and the train
      carriages (when they arrive) will likely be emptier. Blocking a part of
      the platform will not be welcome by Londoners trying to get past.
    * Do not stop directly in front of ticket barriers. Ensure your Oyster/
      ticket/Travelcard are ready before entering the station.


The London Underground  - also known popularly as The Tube - has trains
that criss-cross London in the largest underground rail network in the world
(it was also the first, the first section of the Metropolitan Line dates back
to 1863). The Tube is an easy method of transport even for new visitors to
London.
Tube maps  are freely available from any station, most tourist offices and
are prominently displayed in stations and in the back of most diaries. The Tube
is made up of 11 lines each bearing a traditional name and a standard colour on
the Tube map. To plan your trip on The Tube work out first which station is
closest to your starting point and which closest to your destination. You can
change between lines at interchange stations (providing you stay within the
zones shown on your ticket). Since the Tube Map is well designed it is very
easy to work out how to get between any two stations, and since each station is
clearly signed it is easy to work out when to exit your train. Visitors should
be aware, however, that the Tube map is a diagram and not a scaled map, making
it misleading for determining the relative distance between stations as it
makes central stations appear further apart and somewhat out of place - the
most distant reaches of the Metropolitan Line for example are almost 60 km (40
mi) from the centre of the city. In central London, taking The Tube for just
one stop can be a waste of time; Londoners joke about the tourists who use the
Tube to travel between Leicester Square and Covent Garden stations. This is
especially true since the walk from a tube station entrance to the platform at
some central stations can be extensive. The Tube map also gives no information
on Londons extensive overground bus network and its orbital rail network.
Trains run from around 05:30 to about 01:00. They are usually the fastest way
to travel in London, the only problem being the relative expense, and that it
can get extremely crowded during rush hours (07:30-10:00 and 16:30-19:00). On
warm days take a bottle of water with you. Also note that engineering works
usually take place during weekends or the evening. Contact TfL or visit their
web site  especially if you plan to travel on a Saturday or a Sunday when
entire lines may be shut down.
All lines are identified by name (Circle Line, Central Line, Piccadilly Line)
and by colour (on maps). Many lines have multiple branches rather than running
point-to-point so always to check the trains destination (which is shown on
the front of the train, the platform indicator screens and will be broadcast on
the trains PA). Some branch lines (such as the Chesham branch of the
Metropolitan Line or the Kensington Olympia branch of the District Line) run as
shuttles and require a transfer onto the main line. Note that the Northern
Line has two separate routes through the city centre which split at Euston and
rejoin at Kennington, one (officially called the Charing Cross Branch but known
by locals as the West End branch) runs through the West End serving Leicester
Square, Charing Cross and Waterloo, while the other route runs via the City of
London (officially called the Bank branch but also referred to as the City
branch) with major stops at Kings Cross and Bank.
Despite the confusing layout of the line, it is fairly easy to work out which
way your train is going; for example a northbound Northern Line train to
Edgware along the Charing Cross branch will be displayed on the indicator as
Edgware via ChX and the on-board PA will announce This train terminates at
Edgware via Charing Cross. Finally, note that direction signs for the
platforms indicate the geographical direction of the line, not the last stop of
the line. Always always advisable to carry a pocket Tube map (available for
free at most stations) to help you with this.
Almost all stations have automatic ticket barriers. If you pay by Oyster card,
just tap your card against the yellow pad to open the barriers (both upon
entrance and exit). If you have a paper ticket, insert it face-up into the slot
on the front of the machine, and remove it from the top to enter the station.
If you have a single-ticket it will be retained at the exit gate. If you have
luggage or if your ticket is rejected there is normally a staffed gate as well.
Paper tickets can be purchased from vending machines in the station lobby.
There are two types of machine: the older machines that have buttons for
different fare levels and accept only coins and the new touchscreen machines
that have instructions in multiple languages, offer a greater choice of ticket
and accept bills and cr */debit cards (note that if your card has no embedded
microchip, you cannot use these machines, you pay at the ticket counter).
Single tickets are charged at a premium (often costing only a little less than
a 1-day travelcard) of Â£4.50 flat fare for journeys within or beyond Zone 1 or
Â£3 for journeys outside of Zone 1. Single Oyster fares are charged by the
number of zones crossed, starting at Â£2.00 for 1 zone up to Â£5.50 for 6
zones. Paper travel cards valid for 1 day, 3 days or 7 days are also available
and can also be used on buses, National Rail trains, the DLR and Croydon
Tramlink. They are priced by zones: a 1-day travelcard for Zones 1-2 costs
Â£8.80 (day anytime).
**** By bus *****
Double-decker bus in London
Bus stop
Londons iconic red buses are recognized the world over, even if the
traditional Routemaster buses, with an open rear platform and on-board
conductor to collect fares, have been phased out. These still run on Heritage
Route 15 daily between about 09:30 and 18:30, every 15 minutes. Buses are
generally quicker than taking the Tube for short (less than a couple of stops
on the Tube) trips, but for longer ones can be much slower especially when
traffic is heavy. For sightseeing, buses are a much more pleasant way to travel
than the Tube, and cheaper too for a single journey. Out of central London
youre likely to be closer to a bus stop than a tube station.
Over 5 million bus trips are made each weekday; with over 700 different bus
routes you are never far from a bus. Each bus stop has a sign listing routes
that stop there. Bus routes are identified by numbers and sometimes letters,
for example the 73 runs between Victoria and Seven Sisters, and the C1 (C for
Central) runs from Victoria to White City. The letter N before a number
designates a night bus, but a few services without the letter N run 24-hours -
these are uncommon but clearly indicated and can be very useful!
Importantly, since the 6th of July 2014, it is not possible in London to
purchase a bus ticket on the bus, nor can you expect a ticket machine at your
bus stop! You must either have a Pay-as-you-go Oyster card with sufficient
funds, a Travelcard ticket, a bus pass, or a contactless bank payment card (see
note below). For the vast majority of tourists, Oyster cards (either pay-as-
you-go or with a Travelcard loaded) remain the best option. TfL now allow you
to make one more journey on an Oyster card with positive balance, but not
enough to pay the full fare. Your card will go into negative balance, and you
must top it up as soon as possible. The rest of the fare will be taken then.
London Transport has recently enabled using contactless bank cards (e.g. Visa
payWave, MasterCard PayPass) to pay for transport within London. Simply use
your cr *or debit card as if it were an Oyster card and pay the usual Â£1.45
for a single fare. Daily and Monday-Sunday capping also work, but you should be
wary of bank charges for foreign transactions. If you are from overseas and
your bank charges Â£2 for each transaction in British pounds, a few buses a day
can quickly get very expensive! Contactless bank cards are accepted everywhere
where Oyster is and charged the same way.
Youngsters aged 11-15 travel free on buses with an 11-15 Oyster photocard
(which are available for visitors, but unlike Oyster cards, these require an
online application form and you must be prepared to wait four weeks).
Similarly, if aged 16-18, half-price travel is available, but this again
requires an application form and a long wait. Student Oysters (only available
to students studying in London) are available from age 18 and provide a 35%
discount on weekly and monthly travel cards.
Buses display their route number in large digits at the front, side and rear.
All bus stops have their location and the direction of travel on them.
The iBus system has now been rolled out the iBus on every bus and garage in
London. This new system provides bus times and destination information on a
audio-visual display.
Unlike The Tube one way tickets do not allow you to transfer to different
buses.
Bus_route_map
*** Night bus ****
Standard bus services run from around 00:30-05:30 (12:30 AM to 5:30 AM). Around
half past midnight the network changes to the vast night bus network of well
over 100 routes stretching all over the city. There are two types of night
buses: 24 hour routes and N-prefixed routes.
24-hour services keep the same number as during the day and will run the exact
same route, such as the number 88, for example. N-prefixed routes are generally
very similar to their day-route, but may take a slightly different route or are
extended to serve areas that are further out. For example, the 29 bus goes from
Trafalgar Square to Wood Green during the day; however, the N29 bus goes from
Trafalgar Square to Wood Green and on to Enfield.
Night buses run at a 30 minute frequency at minimum, with many routes at much
higher frequencies up to every 5 minutes.
Prices stay the same, and daily travelcards are valid until 04:00 the day after
they were issued, so can be used on night buses. Most bus stops will have night
bus maps with all the buses to and from that local area on it, although it is
good to check on the TfL website beforehand, which also has all those maps
easily available.
Londons night buses are occasionally used by loud drunks who when provoked,
can be quite confrontational but rarely violent. Stay polite and on the bottom
deck of the bus to best avoid them although there will be just as many if not
more friendly drunks who would be up for a chat. Use your instincts.
**** By DLR *****
Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is a dedicated light rail network operating in
East_London, connecting with the tube network at Bank, Tower Gateway (close to
Tower Hill tube station), Canning Town, Heron Quays (close to Canary Wharf tube
station) and Stratford. As the trains often operate without a driver, it can be
quite exciting - especially for children - to sit in front and look at through
the window, whilst feeling as though one is driving the train oneself. The DLR
also runs above ground on much of its route, and travels through many
picturesque parts of London, including the Docklands area where most of
Londons skyscrapers are located. Apart from the trains looking slightly
different and running slightly less frequently than the Tube, visitors may as
well treat the two systems as the same.
Unlike the tube, the DLR uses the honor-system at all stations apart from Bank
and Stratford. Tickets are available from the machines at stations (most
stations are unstaffed so make sure you are armed with a handful of coins or
low-denomination notes) and are distance-based. Travelcards are also accepted,
as are Oyster cards, which must be validated when entering the platform, and
then validated again when exiting the station.
The DLR can be a little confusing as the routes are not easily distinguished -
generally trains run between Bank - Lewisham, Stratford - Lewisham, Bank -
Woolwich Arsenal, Stratford - Woolwich Arsenal and Tower Gateway - Beckton.
Displays on the platform will tell you the destination and approximate wait for
the next 3 trains, and the destination is also displayed on the front and side
of the train.
**** By train *****
Wikitravel has a guide to Rail_travel_in_the_United_Kingdom, with information
applicable to using the National Rail system within London.
The British railway system is known as National Rail (although some older signs
still refer to it as "British Rail"). Londons suburban rail services are
operated by several private companies under tightly-written government
contracts, and mostly run in the south of the city, away from the main tourist
sights. Only one line (Thameslink) runs through central London - on a north-
south axis between London Bridge or Blackfriars stations, and the underground
level of St Pancras main line station. There is no one central station -
instead, there are twelve mainline stations dotted around the edge of the
central area, and most are connected by the Circle line (except Euston,
Fenchurch St and those South of the river like London Waterloo and London
Bridge). Most visitors will not need to use National Rail services except for a
few specific destinations such as Hampton Court, Kew Gardens (Kew Bridge
station), Windsor Castle, Greenwich or the airports, or indeed if they are
intending to visit other cities in the UK. Since 2 January 2010, pay-as-you-go
Oyster cards are accepted on all routes within London travel zones 1-6.
Visitors are well advised to remember that the quickest route between two
stations might be a combination of the Tube as well as the National Rail
network. (For example: getting to Wimbledon from central London by Tube using
the District Line takes significantly longer (around 45 minutes) than taking
the National Rail service from Waterloo to Wimbledon (around 15 minutes).)
Airport Express Rail services run to Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton
airports - tickets are generally sold at a premium and Oyster cards not valid.
**** By Overground *****
In common parlance, Londoners may refer to travelling by "overground" (or
"overland"), meaning going by National Rail (as opposed to going by
Underground). However, only one service is officially called Overground -
London Overground is a Transport for London rail service. It is operated and
promoted just like the Underground, with the logo like the Tube (except orange)
on stations and full acceptance of Oyster cards. London Overground appears on
the Tube map as an orange line, and services run across North_London suburbs
from east to west. Overground services can be a useful shortcut for crossing
the city, bypassing the centre, for example from Kew Gardens to Camden. London
Overground services also connect busy Clapham Junction railway station in the
Southwest to West London (Shepherds Bush and Kensington) and Willesden Junction
in the Northwest.
**** By tram (Tramlink) *****
Tramlink, opened in 2000, is the first modern tram system to operate in London.
South London is poorly served by the Tube and lacks east-west National Rail
services so the network connects Wimbledon in South West London to Beckenham in
South East London and New Addington, a large housing estate in South Croydon.
The network is centred on Croydon, where it runs on street-level tracks around
the Croydon Loop.
Route 3 (Wimbledon to New Addington - green on the Tramlink map) is the most
frequent service, running every 7 1/2 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and
every 15 minutes at all other times. Beckenham is served by Routes 1 and 2
(yellow and red on the Tramlink map), which terminate at Elmers End and
Beckenham Junction respectively. Both services travel around the Loop via West
Croydon and run every 10 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 30
minutes at all other times. Between Arena and Sandilands, these two services
serve the same stops.
**** By cycle *****
Cycling in the United Kingdom
    * Cycling on the pavement (sidewalk) is illegal, except where a cycle route
      has been designated by signs or painted lines.
    * When cycling on roads, you must ride on the left with other vehicles and
      not more than two abreast.
    * You must have working front and rear lights during hours of darkness.
      Flashing LED lights are legal. Reflective and Day-Glo clothing is always
      a good idea even during the day.
    * Helmets_are_not_compulsory_for_cyclists_in_the_United_Kingdom, and their
      effectiveness is as much a matter of debate here as anywhere else. In
      London, many cyclists, especially those seen in rush hour, also wear
      filter masks, but their efficacy is even more disputed.
    * It is as illegal for cyclists to jump through a red light as it is for
      motorists. Advance stop lines at traffic lights allow cyclists to wait
      ahead of other traffic at red lights. In practice, most car drivers
      ignore this and occupy the cycle space when waiting at lights.
The rules for cyclists are available in the British Government publication "The
Highway_Code"
Due to the expense of other forms of transport and the compactness of central
London, cycling is a tempting option. Excellent_free_cycle_maps can be obtained
from your local tube stations, bike shop, or ordered on-line.
London now offers a city-wide cycle_hire_scheme, operated by Transport for
London. For an hourly charge, bicycles may be hired from automated hire
stations around the city. The bikes, all coloured a distinctive bright blue,
can be unlocked and ridden around the city with a cr *card, and must be
returned to another hire station by locking the bike into the rack.
Despite recent improvements, London remains a relatively hostile environment
for cyclists. London motorists seem reluctant to acknowledge the existence of
cyclists, especially at busy junctions. The kind of contiguous cycle lane
network found in many other European cities does not exist. The safest option
is to stick to minor residential roads where traffic can be surprisingly calm
outside rush hours.
Most major roads in London will have a red-route (indicated by red-painted
tarmac) which is restricted to buses, taxis and bicycles. There are many bus
stops on red routes, which can present a problem cycling around buses.
Cycle-lanes exist in London but they are often sporadic at best - usually a 3-
foot wide section of tarmac barely wide enough for one cyclist typically
indicated by green-painted tarmac. Many improvements have been made for
cyclists in the city over the last few years, even if they remain no more than
gestures in most places. Noticeably, there are many new signposted cycle routes
and some new cycle lanes, not to mention more cyclists since the 2005 public
transport attacks. A new network of "Cycle_super-highways" has recently been
launched: these are indicated by bright blue-painted tarmac. Motor vehicles
often park on cycle lanes, rendering them unusable.
The towpaths in North London along the Grand Union Canal and Regents Canal are
the closest thing to a truly traffic-free cycle path in the capital. The Grand
Union canal connects Paddington to Camden and the Regents Canal connects
Camden to Islington, Mile End and Limehouse in East London. It takes about 30-
40min to cycle from Paddington station to Islington along the towpaths. In
summer they are crowded with pedestrians and not suitable for cycling, but in
winter or late in the evening they offer a very fast and safe way to travel
from east to west in North London. Many cyclists enjoy cutting through one of
Londons enormous parks. It is more of a peaceful way of cycling than riding on
the road.
Care should be taken as to where you choose to park your bike. Many areas, some
surprisingly busy, attract cycle thieves, while chaining a bicycle to a railing
which appears to be private property can occasionally lead to said bike being
removed.
Taking bikes on trains is very limited in London due to overcrowding. Non-
folding bikes can be taken only on limited sections of The Tube network, mostly
only on the above-ground sections outside peak hours. For this reason, folding
bicycles are becoming increasingly popular. There is a map showing this on the
Transport for London website. Most National Rail operators allow bicycles
outside peak hours also.
Critical Mass London is a cycling advocacy group which meets for regular rides
through central London at 6PM on the last Friday of each month. Rides start
from the southern end of Waterloo Bridge.
The London Cycling Campaign  is an advocacy group for London cyclists. With
active local groups in most of the citys boroughs, it is recognised by local
and regional government as the leading voice for cycling in the capital.
**** By taxi *****
London Cab
London has two types of taxis: the famous black cab, and so-called minicabs.
Black cabs are the only ones licensed to ply for hire (ie pick people up off
the street), while minicabs are more accurately described as private hire
vehicles and need to be pre-booked.
The famous black cab of London (not always black!) can be hailed from the curb
or found at one of the many designated taxi ranks. It is possible to book black
cabs by phone, for a fee, but if you are in central London it will usually be
quicker to hail one from the street. Their amber TAXI light will be on if they
are available. Drivers must pass a rigorous exam of central Londons streets,
known as The Knowledge, in order to be licensed to drive a black cab. This
means they can supposedly navigate you to almost any London street without
reference to a map. They are a cheap transport option if there are five
passengers as they do not charge extras, and many view them as an essential
experience for any visitor to London. Black cabs charge by distance and by the
minute, are non-smoking, and have a minimum charge of Â£2.40. Tipping is not
mandatory in either taxis or minicabs, despite some drivers expectations! Use
your discretion: if you like the service you may tip otherwise dont. Londoners
will often just round up to the nearest pound.
Taxis are required by law to take you up to 12 miles or up to one hour
duration, if the destination is in Greater London (20 miles if_starting_at
Heathrow_Airport) if their TAXI light is on when you hail them, unless they
have a good reason. However some, especially older drivers, dislike leaving the
centre of town, or going south of the River Thames. A good way to combat being
left at the side of the curb is to open the back door, or even get into the
cab, before stating your destination.
Minicabs are normal cars which are licenced hire vehicles that you need to book
by phone or at a minicab office. They generally charge a fixed fare for a
journey, best agreed before you get in the car. Minicabs are sometimes cheaper
than black cabs, although this is not necessarily the case for short journeys.
Minicabs can be significantly cheaper for airport journeys - for example, a
minicab from Heathrow to South-West London will cost around Â£36, whereas a
black cab will cost over Â£100. Drivers are not tested as rigorously as black
cab drivers, so they will typically not speak English very well and rely on a
GPS to find their way, but will still get you from A to B. Licensed minicabs
display a Transport For London (TFL) License Plate - usually in the front
window. One of the features of the license plate is a blue version of the
famous London Underground "roundel". A list of licensed minicab operators can
be found at TfL Findaride: . Note that some areas in London are poorly
serviced by black cabs, particularly late at night. This has led to a large
number of illegal minicabs operating - just opportunistic people, with a car,
looking to make some fast money. Some of these operators can be fairly
aggressive in their attempts to find customers, and its now barely possible to
walk late at night through any part of London with a modicum of nightlife
without being approached. You should avoid mini-cabs touting for business off
the street or outside nightclubs, and either take a black cab, book a licensed
minicab by telephone, or take a night bus. These illegal drivers are unlicensed
and sadly they are often unsafe: a number of women are assaulted every week by
illegal minicab operators (11 reported per month).
    * [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/campaign/be-cabwise Cabwise is a free service
      provided by TFL which can text you local licensed minicab numbers if you
      text CAB to 60835. Theres also an app.
**** By car *****
Londoners who drive will normally take public transport in the centre; follow
their example. Unless you have a disability, there is no good reason whatsoever
to drive a car in central London.
Car drivers should be aware that driving into central London on weekdays during
daylight hours incurs a hefty charge, with very few exemptions (note that
rental cars also attract the charge). Cameras and mobile units record and
identify the number plates and registration details of all vehicles entering
the charging zone with high accuracy. The Central London Congestion Charge 
M-F 07:00-18:00 (excluding public holidays) attracts a fee of Â£8 if paid the
same day, or Â£10 if paid on the next charging day. Numerous payment options
exist: by phone, online, at convenience stores displaying the red C logo in
the window and by voucher. Failure to pay the charge by midnight the next
charging day (take note!) incurs a hefty automatic fine of Â£80 (Â£40 if paid
within 2 weeks).
Despite the Congestion Charge, London - like most major cities - continues to
experience traffic snarls. These are, of course, worse on weekdays during peak
commuting hours (i.e. between 07:30-09:30 and 16:00-19:00). At these times
public transport (and especially the Tube) usually offers the best alternative
for speed and reduced hassle. Driving in Central London is a slow, frustrating,
expensive and often unnecessary activity. There are many sorts of automatic
enforcement cameras and it is difficult (and expensive) to park. A good tip is,
that outside advertised restriction hours, parking on a single yellow line is
permissible. Parking on a red line or a double yellow line is never permissible
and heavily enforced. Find and read the parking restrictions carefully! Parking
during weekdays and on Saturday can also mean considerable expense in parking
fees - fees and restrictions are ignored at your extreme financial peril -
issuing fines, clamping and towing vehicles (without warning!) has become a
veritable new industry for borough councils staffed by armies of traffic
wardens.
For the disabled, driving can be much more convenient than using public
transport. If disabled and a resident of a member state of the EU, then two
cars can be permanently registered for free for the congestion charge.
Motorcycles and scooters are fairly common in London as they can pass
stationary cars, can usually be parked for free and are exempt from congestion-
charging. Scooters and bikes with automatic transmission are much more
preferable - a manually-geared racing bike is completely impractical unless you
have excellent clutch-control (although it has to be said you will see plenty
of them being ridden aggressively by motorcycle couriers and locals as it can
be the fastest way to get around!) Likewise to bicycles, car-drivers have a
disregard to anyone on two wheels and larger vehicles have an unwritten
priority so take care when crossing junctions. Crash helmets are mandatory.
Parking for bikes is usually free - there are designated motorcycle-parking
areas on some side-streets and some multi-level parking lots will have bike
parking on the ground level.
**** By boat *****
A river bus at Tower Millennium Pier
London is now starting to follow the example of cities such as Sydney and
Bangkok by promoting a network of river bus and pleasure cruise services along
the River Thames. London River Services  (part of Transport for London)
manages regular commuter boats and a network of piers all along the river and
publishes timetables and river maps similar to the famous tube map. While boat
travel may be slower and a little more expensive than tube travel, it offers an
extremely pleasant way to cross the city with unrivaled views of the London
skyline - Big Ben, St Pauls Cathedral, the Tower of London, etc. Sailing under
Tower Bridge is an unforgettable experience.
Boats are operated by private companies and they have a separate ticketing
system from the rest of London transport; however if you have a Travelcard you
get a 33% discount on most boat tickets. Many boat operators offer their own
one-day ticket - ask at the pier kiosks. Generally, tickets from one boat
company are not valid on other operators services. Oyster cards can be used as
payment for the Clipper-styled commuter services but not for tour boats.

As well as the Thames, consider a trip along an old Victorian canal through the
leafy suburbs of North London. The London_Waterbus_Company runs scheduled
services (more in summer, less in winter) from Little Venice to Camden Lock
with a stop at the London Zoo (pick up only). The 45-minute trip along Regents
Canal is a delightful way to travel.
**** By skate *****
Inline skating on roads and pavements (sidewalks) is completely legal, except
in the City_of_London (a district). Roads are not the greatest but easily
skatable. In the centre drivers are more used to skaters than in the outskirts.
</blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Work</h2><br />London is one of the worlds leading financial centres and so professional
services is the main area of employment, although this sector has been hit hard
by the global financial crisis. As of Mid 2010, the job market in London has
recovered somewhat, it is best to check with recruiters and staffing agencies.
London is hugely popular as a working holiday destination - work in bars and
the hospitality industry is relatively easy to find.
Wages are generally higher in London than the rest of the UK, although the cost
of living is higher still.

Budget    Under Â£70
Mid-range Â£70 to Â£140
Splurge   Over Â£140
London has a wide range of accommodation to suit all tastes from hostels
through historic bed and breakfasts (B&amp;Bs), mainstream chain hotels and
apartments all the way to some of the most famous and exclusive luxury hotels
in the world such as The Savoy, The Ritz and Claridges. Hotel rates in London
are notoriously expensive, and considerably higher than the UK (and indeed,
European) average. Prices invariably become even more inflated close to major
sporting tournaments (such as the London Marathon, Wimbledon or major England
football/rugby fixtures), or other important events (such as Royal ceremonies)
taking place in the city - so it pays to plan your trip around such occasions
or book your accommodation well in advance.
Most people want to base themselves within the central area of London (Zones 1
and 2 of the Underground) - but this is also by far the most expensive part of
the city to stay in, with even the traditional "budget" hotel chains like
Premier Inn or Travelodge charging a premium in the centre compared to
properties located just on the fringes of Zone 2 or in the outer boroughs. Be
wary therefore of big-name chain hotels with "London" in their title that look
suspiciously cheap - you may find that they are actually in the outer suburbs
or even on the outskirts of the city with a commute of nearly an hour into Zone
1. Hotel prices are often linked to their proximity to a Tube or overground
railway station with a fast link to the centre of town, so for this reason do
your research carefully - sometimes being that extra five minutes away from a
station can make the difference in cost and quality and local food and drinking
options. In any case, you can always catch a bus anyway - by far the best way
to see the city and get about generally.
**** Hotels *****
Your budget will have a lot to do with what part of London you will want to
stay in. Generally speaking, the rates you can expect to pay are as follows:
    * Â£15-Â£30 p/n will buy a bunk within a shared dormitory in a hostel
      within Zone 1, or possibly a Bed and Breakfast within the outer suburbs.
      It is also possible to find an advance purchase rate in any of the budget
      hotel chains (Premier Inn, Travelodge, ibis) at this price, but again you
      will be basing yourself in at least Zone 3 probably or further out.
    * Â£40-Â£80 p/n expect to pay this for a small independent 1- or 2- star
      hotel or guest house in Zone 1 or 2. Rooms at this price range tend to be
      very small and the quality can admittedly be somewhat hit and miss. Some
      of these establishments offer excellent value for money, whilst others
      can be very poor indeed. Always do your research online before booking
      therefore!
    * Â£80-Â£150 p/n is realistically the starting point for a room in a 2-
      3 star mainstream chain hotel within Zone 1 or 2. The aforementioned
      budget chains tend to average out at the Â£100 p/n mark.
    * Â£150-Â£300 p/n is the rack rate for a 4-5 star hotel such as a Hilton or
      Marriott. As with most things, prices can be volatile, and can
      occasionally sink to less than the lesser brand names, but inflate
      markedly depending on time of year.
    * Â£400+ p/n (to almost any amount) is the going rate for a luxury hotel
      within the West End or the City, and even the more modest chain hotels
      have been known to charge this amount during periods of high demand - the
      Summer Olympics of 2012 was a prime example. Suites in famous luxury
      hotels such as The Savoy or Claridges can run into Â£1000s per night
      (even tens of thousands!), and are generally aimed at those who dont
      have to ask the price!
Many of the big name hotel chains now offer substantial discounts (with rates
often down as low as Â£30-Â£50 per room per night) if you book well in advance,
but the drawback is that you have to pay the full amount upfront at the time of
booking and there are no refunds if you cancel. The heart of the West End is
the most expensive place to stay with most hotels being either 4 or 5 star and
are therefore priced accordingly.
The_City can also be very expensive during the week, as it relies heavily on
the business market but prices often drop over the weekend and it can be a good
way of getting into a higher standard of accommodation than you could otherwise
afford. Bear in mind though that this part of central London becomes a ghost
town over the weekend, and you will find that few (if any) bars and restaurants
will be open.
A top tip however is to always check the likes of LondonTown.com,
Priceline.com, Expedia, Booking.com, Travoline.com, Kayak.com, Hotels.com and
LateRooms as well as the hotels own website - since there are often deals to
be had which can reduce the costs significantly.
The extra cost of getting around is probably not significant compared to
savings made by staying in a hotel further out. With the excellent Tube system
where you stay wont limit what you see. Always be sure though to check where
the closest tube station is to your hotel. Staying further out will be cheaper
but when travelling in allow 1-2Â min per tube stop (near the centre), around
2-3 min per stop (further out) and 5-10Â min per line change. This can easily
total up to a 1 hour journey if there is a walk at each end.
A more imaginative alternative could be to stay in a nearby town with quick and
easy train travel to London. For example, lively Brighton (otherwise known as
London by Sea) is only an hour away, but your budget will go much further and
there are excellent accommodation options.
Some of the better value options are to be found in the following central
districts:
    * Bloomsbury. Relatively quiet district with a wide range of accommodation,
      and has enjoyed a surge in popularity following Eurostars move to St
      Pancras International station. Cartwright Gardens features a dozen small
      B&amp;Bs in historic houses. Many budget options are located on Argyle
      Square (just off the Euston Road). Gets a little seedy towards and beyond
      Kings Cross railway station.
    * Earls_Court_and_West_Kensington in west central London. Budget and
      modest accommodation as well as good 4-star hotels. Be careful with the
      cheapest accommodation in this area though as it will likely be very
      seedy indeed.
    * Paddington_and_Bayswater in north west central London. Has undergone a
      lot of change recently largely resulting from the Heathrow Express train
      coming into Paddington station. Good hotels can be found in the immediate
      area of the station and in quieter spots a short walk away as well as in
      the traditional mid-range accommodation area further south in Bayswater.
    * Westminster. Lots of small B&amp;Bs around the back of Victoria railway
      station in the Pimlico area.
Also, consider Heathrow_Airport and the surrounding area - although it is 15 mi
(20km) from the heart of the city, you are spoilt for choice for hotels both in
and around the airport boundary, and with the frequent transport links to and
from the centre, not too much of a handicap. You can often get into big name
chain hotels a lot cheaper than their equivalents in the West End for example,
with the obvious advantage of being close to the airport on the days when you
are travelling.
A slightly left-field option is to check the Landmark_Trust, a building
preservation charity who purchase notable old buildings in the UK, renovate and
run them as holiday lettings. An interesting approach to saving old buildings
for sure.
Popular Budget Hotel Chains include Premier_Inn, Travelodge, Space_Apart_Hotel
and Britannia_Hotels so it is usually worth checking these out first. The
standard is of course suited to the budget traveller but rooms are usually
clean, comfortable and well maintained. Travelodge in Barking is a good pick.
Although you are further from the City Centre you are still on the underground
system (Zone 4) and just 35Â min from Kings Cross. And if youre lucky you can
get rooms there from Â£19 per room per night, which might make the extra travel
time worth it!
**** Hostels *****
Not necessarily as unpleasant as you may think, and as long as you dont mind
sharing with others, they are the most cost-effective option and also offer
breakfast as well as kitchens for self catering. The "official" Youth Hostel
Association of England and Wales  (YHA) operates five hostels in Central
London. Like everything else, you should book online well in advance - the
hostels usually fill up on Friday and Saturday nights about 14 days before. A
top tip is dont be put off if there is no availability left online, phone the
hostel in question to see if there are still beds available or if there has
been a cancellation. Some of the YHAs properties also offer a limited number
of private family rooms - expect to pay around Â£60 per night.
Keep in mind that for foreign visitors, the YHA hostels will require to see a
form of ID (a passport or national identity card) and a valid membership card
from a local YHI (Youth Hostelling International)-recognised Youth Hostel
association. For British visitors, a valid YHA (SYHA for Scotland) membership
card is all thats required. For all non-YHI members, the YHA will levy a Â£3
welcome stamp per day.
There are a number of other, independent hostels throughout the city and these
are listed in the relevant district articles.
In the summer season, many of the colleges and universities in Central London
open up their student halls of residence as hotels during vacations, at usually
much lower rates than proper hotels, but expect very basic facilities (e.g.
communal bathrooms, no catering facilities), but you will get the personal
privacy that you dont get in hostels for not very much more cost. London
University vacation accommodation providers include; UCL_Residences
LSEVactions, TravelStay.com and Cortisso.
**** Apartments *****
Some apartment-hotels offer good value accommodation for those travelling in a
group - often better quality than many hotels but at a cheaper individual rate
per person.
Capsule-style crash spaces are just arriving, but currently these are only in
central locations.
Short-term apartment or flat rentals are an attractive option for many
travelers to London, and there are innumerable agencies offering them, almost
all of them nowadays through the internet. A key consideration for renting a
short term flat is if you are visiting in a large group or a family. In such
cases a short stay in London can be more affordable compared to staying in a
hotel. Your best protection is to deal only with London apartment rental
agencies which have been recommended by independent sources you feel you can
trust, and to deal only with those that accept confirmations via cr *card.
**** Alternative Accommodation *****
Travellers can choose from a variety of homestay styles such as homeswapping
(lovehomeswap.com), living in a temporarily vacated room (anyfriendofours.com)
or the high end version where companies specialize in homestays with full hotel
services such as housekeeping and concierge (viveunique.com). Most of the time
these options are safe but it is important that guests and home-owners take
equal precaution to ensure their valuables are safe guarded. Home-owners should
always provide guests with terms and conditions of their live-in house rules to
ensure there are no mishaps and both parties are at ease. This new trend allows
guests to enjoy a less touristy version of London as most of these homes will
be in residential areas which each have their own unique charm and experiences.
This new trend also allows them to generate additional income or to cover their
rental bills whilst they do so.
**** Holiday Rentals *****
Hotels are generally expensive in London comparing with other European cities,
as a result the city has a vast number of self-catering accommodation on offer,
many of them are apartments in various central areas of the capital. Well
established local sites include Interhome and Alpha_Holiday_Lettings.
</blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Drink</h2><br />London is home to a great many pubs, bars and nightclubs. The online city guide
View London  and the weekly magazine Time Out  can inform you of whats
going in Londons night life, as well as with cultural events in general.
**** Pubs &amp; bars *****
London is an expensive place and your drink is likely to cost more than its
equivalent elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Expect to pay around Â£4 for a pint
of lager or Guinness (or around Â£3.50 for a pint of ale) in an average pub,
but be aware that as with restaurants, pubs close to major tourist attractions
cash in on travellers gullibility so be on your guard for the tourist traps
where higher prices are not unheard of. Despite this however it is still
possible to find a sub-Â£3 pint in central London - but it takes some
determination. If youre looking to save money and meet travellers then pub
crawls are guided tours that run nightly in London. Youll save the ticket
price on the savings you get from discounted drink deals and what you would
have spent on club entry. Two operators "1 Big Night Out" and "Camden Pub
Crawl" operate nightly in Leicester Square and Camden town respectively.
Many local pubs, especially those run by chains like Wetherspoons and Scream
tend to be more reasonably priced with good drink promotions on weekday nights
and during the day. As with the rest of the UK, chain pubs abound which
Londoners tend to avoid like the plague. A good place to get cheap beer is at
any one of the Sam Smiths run pubs that are dotted around Soho and north of
Oxford Street. These pubs are good traditional boozers which are frequented by
the local working population and odd celeb.
In the Bloomsbury_area, check out The Court (near the north end of Tottenham
Court Road) and The Rocket (Euston Road). Both are fairly cheap to drink at,
given that they cater for students of the adjacent University College London.
However since both pubs have been taken over by a new company drinks have
become noticeably more expensive. Directly opposite the British_Library is The
Euston Flyer, popular with locals and commuters alike given its close proximity
to St_Pancras_International railway station.
Classier bars and pubs can be much more expensive. However, the cost of alcohol
drops significantly the further away you go from the centre (though be aware
that West_London tends to be an exception, with prices pretty much the same as
the centre).
Two important endemic London breweries are Youngs and and Fullers. Youngs was
founded in Wandsworth in 1831 (but has recently relocated to Bedford) and
nowadays it boasts 123 pubs in central London alone. The Founders Arms on the
South_Bank is one of the brewerys most well known establishments. Fullers was
founded a bit later in 1845 at Chiswick (where you can take a most enjoyable
tour of the brewery, including beer-tasting) and the jewel in its crown is
probably the Grade I listed Old Bank Of England on Fleet_Street, thanks to its
breath-taking interiors. Fullers flagship beer is the famous London Pride,
however to try a truly authentic Cockney pint, ask at bars if they serve a
seldom seen now Porter, a dark style of beer originating in London in the 18th
Century, similar but less heavy then a Stout. For a different taste, try
London Gin, a popular type of spirit, often mixed with tonic water, (and a
slice of lemon) to make G &amp; Ts.
Its hard to say which pub in London is truly the oldest but its easy to find
contenders for the title. Many pubs were destroyed in the Great Fire of London
â indeed, Samuel Pepys supposedly watched the disaster from the comfort of
the Anchor in Borough. Pubs were rebuilt on sites that claimed to have been
working pubs since the 13th century. Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese in Fleet_Street is
on the site of an old monastery and its cellar dates back to the 13th century.
The Princess Louise and Cittie of Yorke (22 High Holborn, WC1V 6BN Tel +44 20
7242-7670) are two lovely pubs close by, along High Holborn with interesting
decor; as is the Jerusalem Tavern of Farringdon, a converted Georgian coffee
shop, which sells the Norfolk beer, St. Peters. The Royal Oak of Borough, is
another pub which is the only representative of an out-of-town brewery in
London, that of Harveys of Lewes. The food is fantastic as is the atmosphere.
Those interested in Londons historic and literary connections cant miss The
Spaniards Inn in Hampstead. Dick Turpin is said to have been born here; John
Keats and Charles Dickens both drank here; its mentioned in Dickens The
Pickwick Papersand Bram Stokers Dracula. The Goose at Catford, was reputedly a
favourite hole of Karl Marx.
For the best view in the city, try pubs on the banks of the Thames. The South
Bank has lots of good bars with plenty of iconic bridges and buildings in sight
the cocktail bar in the OXO tower is a secret that most tourists walk by
everyday. Heading towards Bermondsey, pub crowds become a little less touristy.
If youre after gastropubs, you may like to visit Londons first, The Eagle, in
Clerkenwell, established in 1991. You can also try Time Outs favourite
newcomer, The Princess Victoria on Uxbridge Road, Shepherds_Bush.
Wine buffs can enjoy the famous Davys wine bars that dot the city. The company,
established in 1870, import wines and own over thirty bars in the centre. Other
big names in wine include the Michelin-starred Cellar Gascon and Vinoteca, both
in Smithfield. For a posh wine tasting experience, there is Vinopolis by
Borough Market, though a tour price will be as eye-watering as the produce
sampled.
Big hotels, such as The Dorchester and The Ritz, and upmarket clubs around
Leicester_Square and Soho are reliable bets for a date at the bar. The
Connaught Hotel in Mayfair-Marylebone boasts its house bar, plus the Time Out
favourite, The Coburg. Still in Mayfair, The Polo Bar at The Westbury is very
intimate.
You can rely on most up-and-running bars to offer a short cocktail menu and
there are also bars that position themselves as cocktail specialists.
**** Nightclubs *****
Nightlife is an integral part of London life and there are countless nightclubs
in and around Central London with music to suit even the most eclectic of
tastes. Districts in London tend to specialize to different types of music.
The Farringdon/Hoxton/Shor *ch_area has many clubs playing drum and bass,
house and trance music and is home to the superclub Fabric. The clubs in this
area are often home to the worlds top DJs and attracts a lively, hip and
friendly crowd.
The area around Mayfair is home to the more upmarket clubs in London. This area
attracts a rather more showy crowd who love to flaunt what they have and is a
must go to celebrity spot. Beware that drinks are ridiculously expensive and
many clubs operate a guestlist-only policy. Music played here is often of the
commercial chart, funky house, hip hop and R&amp;B genre. Notable clubs include
China White, Luxx, Maddox, Jalouse, Funky Buddha, Whisky Mist, Mahiki, No 5
Cavendish Square, Embassy, Vendome and Maya.
Nightclubs around the Leicester_Square area hold the same music policy, but are
rather more accessible, with numerous club and pub crawl promoters scattered
around the area offering deals on entry. Notable clubs are Cafe De Paris, 1 Big
Night Out pub crawl, Penthouse, Sound, Tiger Tiger, Zoo bar and Ruby Blue.
The Camden area is home to clubs which play Indie, metal and rock music and
notably the Electric Ballroom, the world famous Koko (Fridays) and Underworld,
however be aware that Camden clubs are mostly shut (or empty) on the weekdays.
**** Gay and lesbian *****
London has a vibrant gay environment with countless bars, clubs and events in
almost every district in the city.
The nucleus of Londons gay scene is undoubtedly Old Compton St and the
surrounding area in Soho, whilst Vauxhall has also grown significantly in the
last decade - with a generally more seedier and fetish-oriented selection of
bars and clubs compared to those of Soho. You will find that many areas,
particularly in Camden_Town and Shor *ch, that straight bars will have a
mixed clientele.
To find out what is going on during your visit, you can check:
    * qmagazine.com  a weekly magazine that comprehensively covers the
      London gay scene with handy night by night listings available on-line and
      in print
    * Boyz Magazine  which is published fortnightly and is freely available
      at most London gay venues, and contains listings of everything that is
      happening in all the major clubs in London and the South East.
Pride is held every year in June with parade and street parties. The choice of
places to go sometimes seem to be unmanageable.
    * London Gay and Lesbian Switchboard (LLGS), â +44 20 7837-7324
      (admin@llgs.org.uk), . This voluntary service has been operating
      since 1974 and as well as providing counselling they offer an incredibly
      thorough information service about Gay events, accommodation and
      businesses in London. Â  *

Summary map of rail connections to London airports
Due to Londons huge global city status it is the most served destination in
the world when it comes to flights.
London (all airports IATA code: LON) is served by a total of six airports
(Heathrow, Gatwick, City, Stansted, Luton, Southend). Travelling between the
city and the airports is made relatively easy by the large number of public
transport links that have been put in place over recent years. However, if
transiting through London, be sure to check the arrival and departure airports
carefully as transfers across the city may be quite time consuming. In addition
to Londons five official airports (of which only two are located within
Greater London), there are a number of other regional UK airports conveniently
accessible from London. Since they offer a growing number of budget flights,
choosing those airports can be cheaper (or even faster, depending on where in
London your destination is).
For transfers directly between Londons airports, the fastest way (short of a
taxi) is the direct inter-airport bus service by National_Express. Buses
between Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton run at least hourly, with
Heathrow-Gatwick services taking 65min (Â£18) and Heathrow-Stansted services
90min (Â£20.50) (note that services between Stansted and Luton run only every
two hours). However, its essential to allow leeway, as Londons expressways,
especially the orbital M25 and the M1 motorway, are often congested to the
point of gridlock. Some buses have toilets on board.
*** London Heathrow ****
Rail and tube lines go to different terminals at Heathrow
      Main article: Heathrow_Airport
Heathrow_Airport (IATA: LHR) is London and Europes largest airport and the
worlds busiest airport in terms of international passenger movement, with
services available from most major airports world-wide.
T2 was closed for redevelopment until 4 Jun 2014. Terminal 2 will eventually
serve 20 million passengers a year and be home to 23 Star Alliance airlines, as
well as Aer Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Little Red and Germanwings.)
Heathrow is dominated by the UKs flag-carrier British_Airways, who use the
airport as its home base and principal hub, and consequently operate nearly 40%
of all the airports flights. BA occupy all of Terminal 5, and have a major
presence in Terminals 1 and 3. Flights landing at Heathrow are often delayed by
up to an hour as a simple result of air traffic congestion and waiting for
parking slots. To complicate the matter, airlines that fly into Heathrow are
currently playing a system-wide game of musical chairs as gate assignments are
cycled through the new terminal, making it even more necessary for travellers
to check their terminal and gate assignment in advance. Do plan your itinerary
to allocate some time needed to get through Heathrow Airport T3, there can be
long queues if you are not holding an EEA passport.
For transport options into town, see our Heathrow_Airport article...
*** London_Gatwick ****
(IATA: LGW) Londons second airport, also serving a large spectrum of places
world-wide. It is the worlds busiest single runway airport and is split into a
North and South Terminal. The two terminals are linked by a free shuttle train
(5 minutes). The train station is located in the South Terminal. To get to the
centre of the city, there are various rail options and two bus options; please
note the wide range of prices. If you need a Travelcard added on, to cover any
onward travel that same day on Underground or bus, Tickets valid on trains
branded Express are most expensive - Â£30.10, compared to Â£15.20 with Southern
and only Â£13 with First Capital Connect; this cheapest option connects with
more Underground lines than the other two, and takes about the same time.
    * By rail: Gatwick Express, â +44 20 8528 2900, . Every 15 min,
      journey time 30-35 min. Gatwick Express is a brand name of Southern
      Railway, and used on certain trains. See entry for Southern below. One
      way Â£19.90, round trip Â£33.20, for the cheapest fare visit their
      website. Â  *
    * By rail: Southern Railway, â +44 20 8185 0778, . Every 15 min,
      journey time 35-40 min. All services between Gatwick and Victoria are
      operated by Southern Railway. Some trains operated by Southern carry
      âExpressâ branding: premium fares are charged for these services. The
      time saving on the âExpressâ trains compared to the normal services
      is minimal, 30/35 minutes for âExpressâ compared to 35/40 minutes for
      normal services. The normal services call at intermediate stations
      (usually East Croydon and Clapham Junction) whereas services branded
      âExpressâ run non-stop. There is little differentiation in on-board
      comfort - the âExpressâ trains use commuter type carriages, similar
      to all other trains serving Gatwick. During rush hour periods the
      âExpressâ services continue onwards to/from Brighton and will be busy
      with commuters. For most of the day, both âexpressâ services and
      âordinaryâ services run at least every fifteen minutes. Southern also
      operate services to Milton Keynes (north of London) - these use an
      orbital rail line through the Earls Court area which avoid central
      London. Prices (2013 fares, will be higher in 2014). One way Â£19.90
      (valid on any train) or Â£14.40 (not valid on trains branded
      âExpressâ). Note that for many destinations in central or east
      London, the Thameslink services are a better option - quicker and
      cheaper. Â  *
    * By rail: Thameslink, â +44 871 200 2233, . To Blackfriars (36min),
      City Thameslink, Farringdon, St Pancras International (for Kings Cross,
      46min), Luton Airport and further north. Until 2018 there is a major
      rebuilding programme affecting London Bridge station - this means that
      Thameslink services (which previously served London Bridge) will not stop
      there. Details of service alterations are published at the Thameslink
      website.  Cheaper than any other rail option - Â£10 (they occasionally
      have advance tickets priced at half that), and note the bargain with
      Travelcard added on (see above). Â  *
    * By bus: easyBus, . Every 15-20min, journey time 60-90min. To Earls
      Court/West Brompton. Not recommendable as very unreliable. As of 2013,
      service is horrendous, and the company has no staff at Gatwick, so youre
      on your own. Factor in the cost of getting to the drop off location in
      London before booking. It is far from Victoria station. One way prices
      start from Â£2. Book online.. Â  *
    * By bus: National Express, . Every 30min, journey time 75-110min. To
      London Victoria. As of March 2015 passengers with reservations were being
      turned away when boarding at Victoria. For some reason they are keeping
      seats on the coach free for EasyBus passengers to board later in the
      journey, but the National Express booking system is double booking those
      seats. According to the drivers, several people are turned away from each
      bus, and its especially problematic in the middle of the night. If you
      choose this option, arrive at the station early to make sure you get on.
      One way prices start from Â£7. Book online. Â  *
    * By Minicab, â +44 7505 616915, . Journey time 90-120 min. approx
      Â£70. Â  *
    * By car. 47km (29 mi). The road journey from Gatwick to central London is
      slow - for most visitors a rail journey will be significantly quicker.
      Â  *
    * By cycle, . There is a long-distance cycle path into Central London,
      but as it involves an indirect route, going over the North Downs and
      through South-East London, it will likely be quite a ride. For
      adventurous people. Â  *
After passing through security you will find no drinking fountains in the South
Terminal departure lounge so as to increase the profits of drink vendors.
North Terminal: after passing through security, the intrepid traveller can find
power sockets on many of the large columns. There are accessible sockets to the
right of the left hand door from security, adjacent Super Dry. Starbucks also
has sockets below the seating by the window around the corner from the serving
area. All are unofficial. There are official mobile charging stations (paid)
also.
*** London Stansted ****
Stansted (IATA: STN) is Londons third airport, and is dominated by the two
low-cost airlines EasyJet and Ryanair who use the airport as a hub, as well as
holiday charter airlines Thomson and Pegasus. Stansted also accommodates a few
other scheduled carriers within Europe and a small number of inter-continental
flights.
Sleeping at Stansted Airport
A large number of budget flights depart from Stansted as early as 06:00 (when
the lowest fares are available). However, this presents travellers with a
problem, as the airports location is a long way outside London, and transport
to the airport is sporadic before 05:30.
Due to the high price of accommodation in the city and near the airport, and
the fact that many budget airlines dont pay for accommodation in the event of
cancellation, an increasing number of travellers choose to spend the night in
the airport prior to their flight. A crowd of around 100 travellers (up to 400
in summer) camp in the main departure/arrivals hall every night, effectively
turning it into a giant dormitory.
Tips for sleeping at Stansted Airport:
    * Arrive early, preferably around 22:00, and stake your territory
      immediately. Benches without armrests are in limited supply and fill up
      quickly.
    * If you arrive later, take a floor mat and sleeping bag. Sleeping on the
      floor is tolerated by the staff, but avoid making your bed in front of
      shops and counters.
    * A sleeping bag is generally recommended as the automatic doors constantly
      open and close as passengers arrive, and it can get chilly in winter.
    * Safety is not a problem. The airport is miles away from any settlement
      and security guards oversee the open-plan building 24/7.
    * Ear plugs and eye covers are a must, as the cleaning staff are noisy and
      shop assistants start arriving at 04:00 to open shutters.
    * At least one cafe is open all night, offering snacks and hot drinks.
      Boots the chemist is also open 24/7
    * Toilets remain open and are normally in good condition. There is a
      drinking fountain to the left of the Accessorize store front and the
      security entrance "Door 1", where you can fill water bottles for the
      night.
Stansted is very distant from the centre of London at Charing Cross - almost
38Â mi (60km) away in Essex but less than 29Â mi (47km) from either Cambridge
or Colchester.
There are several commercial Wi-Fi hotspots covering most of the airport, but
they charge extortionate rates. A free Wi-Fi hotspot is in the arrivals gate
area, next to the phone booths offering fixed internet.
Getting to Stansted for an early morning flight is fairly straight forward,
coaches run through the night, provided by Terravision and National Express
from London Victoria and London Liverpool Street. Terravision costs Â£9 one way
and run roughly every hour throughout the night(although, on the rush hours the
qeues for boarding Terravision coaches at the airport may take more then an
hour). Be aware that lines are very common at Stansted, security check can
easily take an hour. Also getting to the airport can take longer than the
proclaimed 90 minutes, expect more like 120 minutes. Arriving in the airport,
queueing for passport control can easily take up to 2 hours for non-EU passport
holders, especially for Sunday night arrivals.

*** London_Luton ****
Luton airport (IATA: LTN) is physically much smaller than Stansted, but still a
major hub for many Low Cost airlines, and over 10 million passengers fly
through the airport each year. It boasts the same facilities of the other major
airports and also like Stansted, it is common place for some passengers on
early morning flight, to sleepover in the terminal before their flights. The
Parkway Airport station, which serves the terminal is about 20 minutes walk
back into town, though there is a regular shuttle bus charging Â£1.50 to take
you to the station. If your train ticket says Luton Airport (rather than Luton
Airport Parkway), then the bus ride is included in the ticket.
The airport is a major hub for easyJet, Ryanair, Wizzair, Thomson Airways and
Monarch Airlines, with other airlines also serving the airport like Aer Arann,
FlyBE and El Al, to cities primarily in Scotland, Europe, North Africa and the
M *erranean Basin. If leaving on a morning flight (departing 07:00-08:30), it
is advisable to leave extra time to check in and clear security due to the
large number of flights leaving (particularly Wizzair).
    * By_rail: journey time: 20-55min and Â£13.50 one way, Travelcard not
      valid. The airport has its own railway station "Luton Airport Parkway",
      and is served by trains 24 hours a day from Central London using "First
      Capital Connect Trains" and connects with St Pancras International. There
      are up to 10 trains an hour, depending on the time of day. All trains go
      to London St Pancras International, but many also continue on to
      Blackfriars, London Bridge and Elephant &amp; Castle, Gatwick Airport and
      Brighton. The station is nearly 2km (1 mi) from the terminal building,
      there is a shuttle bus service running between the terminal and airport
      every 10 minutes, costing Â£1.50 each way. At rush hour times, this
      journey can take up to 25 minutes.
    * By coach: Green Line number 757, â 0844 801 7261 (premium rates from
      most mobiles and non-BT landlines), . Every 20min, journey time
      90min. To Victoria (tube: Victoria) via Brent Cross, Finchley Rd tube
      station, Baker St, Marble Arch and Hyde Park Corner. Â£14 one way if
      bought from the driver. Service is run by Greenline and in conjunction
      with easyBus (but can be used by all travellers regardless of airline you
      travel with). Travelcard not valid. Â  *
    * By coach: National Express, â 0870 580 8080 (premium rates from most
      mobiles and non-BT landlines), . Every 2 min, journey time 90min. To
      Victoria (tube: Victoria) via Golders Green and Marble Arch. From Â£1
      (advance web purchase) one way. Travelcard not valid. Â  *
    * By car. 60km (34 mi) north of London, just off the M1 motorway which
      connects London with the Midlands and the North of England. Depending on
      where you are travelling from in London and time of day, journey times
      take 45-90min. Road users should plan their journey and check traffic
      conditions, as if an incident occurs on Londons busy roads, journey
      times can dramatically increase. There is no free location to wait or
      drop passengers off. It costs Â£1 to stay in the "drop off zone" for a
      maximum of 10 minutes (non-extendable without penalty). There is also a
      short stay car park nearby. Â  *
*** London_City_Airport ****
(IATA: LCY) A commuter airport close to the Citys financial district, and
specialising in short-haul business flights to other major European cities.
There are a growing number of routes to holiday destinations including Malaga,
Ibiza and Majorca. There is also a business class only flight to New York JFK
operated by British Airways.
Not as expensive to fly into as it used to be, and you may indeed find that
from some origins, this may be your cheapest London airport to fly to, without
even considering the cost savings of NOT coming from the distant larger London
airports with Â£10+ transfer costs. Then there is the added bonus that it is
close to central London, with a convenient link on the DLR. Minimum check-in
time for most airlines is around 30 minutes, with some offering 15 minute
check-in deadlines. Queues for security can be long at peak business times.
From touchdown to the DLR (including taxi, disembarkation, immigration and
baggage reclaim) can be as fast at 5 minutes, although 15 minutes is normal.
To get to the city centre the following options exist:
    * By Docklands Light Railway (DLR). See also: Get_around. The DLR runs to
      Bank station (27 minutes). During weekday rush-hours, some trains operate
      to Stratford International. There is a convenient change to the Jubilee
      line at Canning Town. Travelcard valid. Â  *
    * By taxi. Journey time approximately 30 min. Â£20-35. Â  *
    * By car.  10 km (6 mi). Â  *
    * By bus, . Take the 474 bus to Canning Town station and then the 115
      or N15 into central London. See also: Get_around. Travelcard valid.
      Â  *
*** London_Southend ****
(IATA: SEN, ICAO: EGMC) only officially became Londons sixth airport when it
was recently included within IATAs classification of the Metropolitan Area of
London, LON â meaning the airport is now officially London Southend to the
rest of the world and airline booking systems. The name is something of a
creative liberty, since Southend is certainly not in the south end of London -
it is located near the seaside town of Southend-on-Sea in Essex, which is some
42 miles (67km) to the east of the city.
There has been an ongoing programme of development and EasyJet started
operating services in April 2012. A regular rail service runs from Southend
Airport Station to London Liverpool Street Station in central London 36 miles
(58Â km) to the west.
    * London Southend Airport, â +44 1702 608100 (enquiries@stobartair.com),
      . Serves a range of destinations in Europe and the British Isles
      Â  *
By rail, a journey time of 55-65 min. Travelcards are not valid. The airport
has its own railway station "Southend Airport", and is served from Liverpool
Street, via Stratford by trains 17 hours a day. There are up to 8 trains an
hour, depending on the time of day. The station is c. 200Â yd from the terminal
building.

NOTE: Passengers from central London intending to use the first departures of the
day (or the latest arrivals into SEN) should note that the earliest train from
Liverpool Street arrives too late for first flights, and the final train to
Liverpool Street leaves before the final arrival of the day. The airport terminal
building is not open 24 hours a day, opening at 4am and closing at midnight, or
45 minutes after the last flight has landed, so it may sometimes be closed
earlier. Passengers will be asked to leave the terminal building when it closes.
Therefore, this airport is not suitable for sleeping overnight for an early
morning flight. There is a Holiday Inn Express hotel, a few minutes walk from the
terminal, but it is wise to book in advance for better deals and lower prices.
The first train from London arrives at the airport just after 6:30am and the last
train of the day from the airport to London is at 11:05pm. Trains start later and
finish earlier on Sundays and Bank Holidays. If you miss the last train to
London, you could be in for a very expensive taxi journey (taxi fares from the
airport to Liverpool Street station can run up to Â£100!). It is wise to plan
your journey to and from the airport in advance, to prevent dissapointment and
being stranded.

*** Other airports near London ****
    * London Ashford Airport, also known as Lydd Airport has rather seasonal,
      limited services and is used primarily for businessmen.
    * Southampton Airport, â +44 870 040 0009, . Every 30 min, journey
      time 1 hour. (IATA: SOU, ICAO: EGHI) is not officially a London airport,
      though accessible enough to conveniently serve the capital, especially
      South West London. A couple of budget carriers serving an increasing
      number of European destinations are based here. Direct trains connect
      Southampton airport to London Waterloo station. Â£30-35 round trip.
      Â  *Bournemouth Airport similarly operates a couple of Ryanair flight
      amongst others, and is not too far west on the train line from
      Southampton.
    * Birmingham International Airport, â +44 870 733 5511, . (IATA: BHX,
      ICAO: EGBB) is another non-London airport worth considering as a less
      congested and hectic alternative to Heathrow, being just over an hour
      away from London. As a major airport serving the UKs second largest
      city, there is a good choice of long distance and European destinations.
      Direct trains connect Birmingham International to London Euston and
      Watford. The train station is connected to the terminal via a free
      shuttle train (2 minutes). From Â£10 (advance web purchase) one way,
      Â£35-100 round trip. Â  *
    * Other small airports, such as Oxford Airport can also be useful. Kent
      International Airport and Shoreham Airport (near Brighton) are similarly
      small. Biggin Hill in Bromley borough had a rejected licence bid in 2010
      for commercial flights for the Olympics but may recieve one in the near
      future.
**** By train *****
Wikitravel has a guide to Rail_travel_in_the_United_Kingdom.
London is the hub of the British rail network - every major city in mainland
Britain has a frequent train service to the capital, and most of the smaller,
provincial cities and large towns also have a direct rail connection to London
of some sort - although the frequency and quality of service can vary
considerably from place to place.
Rail fares to London vary enormously from very cheap to prohibitively expensive
- the golden rules are to book Advance tickets for a particular train time,
dont travel into the city on Friday afternoons and Sundays, and avoid buying
tickets on the day of travel. There are three basic types of ticket, which are
summarised below. Note that much of the advice applies to rail travel in
general within the United Kingdom.
    * ANYTIME - travel on any train, any operator at any time, returning within
      one month with few restrictions. Very expensive however - on a long
      distance journey from Northern England or Scotland for example - an
      Anytime return ticket to London wont leave you with any change out of
      Â£250!
    * OFF-PEAK - travel on certain trains within a specific time-frame; again
      returning within one month. Typically this excludes anything that arrives
      into London during the morning rush hour (before 10:00 typically), or any
      train which departs during evening rush hour (16:30-18:30). Weekends
      generally carry no restrictions on the use of Off-Peak tickets. There are
      however, a monumentally complex number of exceptions for which Off-Peak
      tickets are and arent valid which are barely fathomable to the British,
      never mind overseas visitors. If you are in any doubt at all about the
      validity of an Off-Peak ticket, ask a guard at the station or a ticket
      office BEFORE getting on a train - as on-train conductors can be
      notoriously unforgiving.
    * ADVANCE - travel on a specific day and train time, booked up to 12 weeks
      in advance either in person at a railway station, over the telephone, or
      online. Two Advance single tickets for the outward and return legs of the
      journey are generally cheaper than the Off-Peak return ticket. Better
      deals can often be had by going directly to the train operators website.
      The earlier you book, the more you save - you can get down to as little
      as Â£12.00 one-way from Scotland for example, but these tickets are non-
      refundable, and cannot be used on anything other than the date, train
      time and operator that is printed on the reservation. Go on any other
      train and get caught and you will be obliged to pay the Anytime fare for
      the journey you are making - which as weve said before is hideously
      expensive!
The local and commuter rail companies within the London and Home Counties area
also have a bewildering array of special fares which are all in essence,
variations of the Off-Peak ticket and are far too detailed to cover here, go
directly to the website of the operator concerned for more information. Note
that if you only intend to use trains within the Greater London boundary, then
the Oyster Card (explained below) is by far the easiest and cheapest option to
use.
Seats can be reserved for free on all long-distance trains to London - the
reservation is always issued automatically with an Advance ticket, and with
most Off-Peak and Anytime tickets bought on-line. If, for whatever reason you
hold an Anytime or Off-Peak ticket and there is no seat reservation coupon,
then it is highly recommended you get one from any railway station ticket
office - if you want to avoid camping out in the vestibule for all or part of
the journey!! First Class is available on all long distance services to London,
the standard of service varies from operator to operator, but in general you
get a wider, more comfortable seat, free tea/coffee for the duration of the
journey, and some sort of complimentary catering service. If can be great value
if you get an Advance first-class fare, but it is extremely expensive
otherwise, and to be honest - not really worth it. You can pay a Weekend
supplement (generally Â£15-Â£20) to sit in the first class section of the train
on Saturdays and Sundays, - useful if the service you are on is hideously
overcrowded - but you dont get the same catering service as during the week.
If you are the holder of a Britrail pass, things are simpler - but remember you
still have to make a seat reservation for the train you intend to travel on -
otherwise you run the risk of standing for the journey! If you intend to use
the overnight Sleeper trains to London, you will have to pay a berth supplement
for every member of your party - provided there is berth availability on the
train.
London has one international high speed rail route (operated by Eurostar 
0870 518 6186 ) from Paris (2h 15min) and Brussels (1h 50 min) diving under the
sea for 35 km (22 mi) via the Channel Tunnel to come out in England. It
terminates at St. Pancras International Station. For domestic train services,
there are no fewer than 12 main line National Rail  terminals (although in
conversation you may hear the brand National Rail infrequently if ever it
differentiates main line and London Underground services; journey planner
online or phone 0845 748 49 50). With the exception of Fenchurch St (tube:
Tower Hill) these are on the London Underground. Most are on the circle line.
Clockwise starting at Paddington, major National Rail stations are:
    * London Paddington, serves South West England and Wales including Slough,
      Maidenhead, Reading, Oxford, Bath, Bristol, Taunton, Exeter, Plymouth and
      Cardiff and Swansea. Also the downtown terminus of the Heathrow Airport
      Express (see above) and serves some suburban stations such as Acton Main
      Line and Ealing Broadway.
    * London Marylebone, serves some north western suburban stations such as
      Amersham, Harrow on the Hill and Wembley Stadium. Also serves Aylesbury,
      High_Wycombe, Banbury, Stratford-upon-Avon and the city of Birmingham. It
      is much cheaper but slightly slower to take a train from Marylebone to
      Birmingham instead of a train from London Euston.
    * London Euston, serves the Midlands, north-west England and west Scotland:
      Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Chester, Oxenholme Lake_District,
      Carlisle, Glasgow, and Holyhead for connecting ferries to/from both the
      Republic_of_Ireland and Northern_Ireland. Sleeper trains to Scotland
      leave from Euston.
    * St Pancras International, serves Paris, Brussels, Lille, as well as Luton
      Airport, Bedford, Brighton, Gatwick Airport, Catford several destinations
      in Kent and the East_Midlands: Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and
      Sheffield.
    * London Kings Cross, serves East_Anglia, north-east England and east
      Scotland: Cambridge, Doncaster, Leeds, York, Kingston_upon_Hull,
      Newcastle_upon_Tyne, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Platform 9 3/4 from the
      Harry Potter books is marked with a special sign, although platform 9
      itself is actually in the fairly unpleasant metallic extension used by
      Cambridge trains.
    * London Moorgate, serves some northern suburbs.
    * London Liverpool Street, serves East_Anglia: Ipswich and Norwich. Also
      the downtown terminus of the Stansted Airport Express.

      Dover, Eastbourne, Hastings and Ramsgate.
    * London Blackfriars, serves Gatwick Airport and Brighton.
    * London Waterloo, serves south west London and England: Portsmouth,
      Winchester, Southampton, Bournemouth, Weymouth, Salisbury and Exeter.
    * London Victoria, serves south east London and England: Brighton, Dover,
      Eastbourne, Hastings, Portsmouth and Ramsgate. Also the downtown terminus
      of the Gatwick Airport Express.
In South London many areas have only National Rail services (no London
Underground services but there are buses). London Bridge, Victoria, Cannon St
and Charing Cross serve the South East. London Waterloo serves the South West.
First Capital Connect (frequently referred to as Thameslink) is a cross London
route between Bedford and Brighton via Luton Airport (Parkway), St. Pancras
International, Farringdon, City Thameslink, Blackfriars, London Bridge and
Gatwick Airport.
**** By bus *****
Most international and domestic long distance bus (UK English: coach) services
arrive at and depart from a complex of coach stations off Buckingham Palace
Road in Westminster close to London Victoria rail station. All services
operated by National Express or Eurolines (see below) serve Victoria Coach
Station, which actually has separate arrival and departure buildings. Services
by other operators may use this station, or the Green Line Coach Station across
Buckingham Palace Road. The following are amongst the main coach operators:
    * National Express, â 0870 580 8080, .  is by far the largest
      domestic coach operator and operates services to / from London from
      throughout England, Wales and Scotland. Advance ticketing is usually
      required and recommended practice in any case. Fares are low - especially
      when booked in advance via the web. A few journeys are fast but most are
      notably slower than using the train. Â  *
    * Eurolines, â 0870 514 3219, .  is an associate company of National
      Express, and runs coach services to / from London with various cities in
      Northern_Ireland, the Ireland and continental Europe. Advance ticketing
      is required. Â  *
    * Megabus, â 0900 160 0900 (premium rate), .  operates budget coach
      services from/to London (Victoria Coach Station) to/from several major
      regional cities in the UK and continental Europe. Fares are demand
      responsive but can be very cheap (Â£1.50 if you book far enough in
      advance). Megabus also offer a Sleeper service to Glasgow and Edinburgh.
      Â  *
    * Greyhound, â 0900 096 0000 (premium rate), .  coach services with
      free wi-fi, newspapers and extra legroom. From/to London (Victoria Coach
      Station) to/from several cities. Fares can be very cheap. Â  *
**** By car *****
London is the hub of the UKs road network and is easy to reach by car, even if
driving into the centre of the city is definitely not recommended. Greater
London is encircled by the M25 orbital motorway, from which nearly all the
major trunk routes to Scotland, Wales and the rest of England radiate. The most
important are listed below.
    * M1: The main route to/from the North, leading from the East Midlands,
      Yorkshire and terminating at Leeds. Most importantly, Britains longest
      motorway - the M6, branches from the M1 at Rugby, leading to Birmingham,
      Liverpool, Manchester, the Lake District and onwards to the Scottish
      border, and ultimately Glasgow.
    * A1/A1(M) The A1 is the original, historic "Great North Road" between
      England and Scotlands capital cities and has largely been converted to
      motorway standard; it runs up the eastern side of Great Britain through
      Peterborough, York, Newcastle and continues north through Northumberland
      and the Scottish Borders to Edinburgh.
    * M40/A40: Arrives in London from a north westerly direction, linking the
      city with Oxford and providing an additional link from Birmingham.
    * M4: The principal route to/from the West - leading to Bath, Bristol and
      cities South Wales (Cardiff and Swansea). It is also the main route
      towards Heathrow Airport.
    * M3: The main route to London from the shipping port of Southampton.
    * M2/M20: Together, these motorways are the main link to the coastal ferry
      (and Channel Tunnel) ports of Dover and Folkestone from Continental
      Europe.
    * M11: The M11 connects Stansted Airport and Cambridge to London, and it
      terminates on the north eastern periphery of the city.
In addition to the M25, here are two inner ring roads in London which skirt the
central area:
    * A406/A205 North Circular/South Circular The North Circular is a half
      circle on the North of the Thames, and is mostly a dual carriageway. It
      has direct connections with the M4, M40, M1 and M11 motorways and can be
      useful if you want to quickly get around the northern suburbs of the
      city. The corresponding South Circular is really a local road which is
      made up of segments of main suburban thoroughfares. The two roads are
      connected at the east end of the circle in North Woolwich/Woolwich
      Arsenal by the Woolwich Free Ferry, which runs approx. every 10-15 min
      and is free of charge, although it can only carry a limited amount of
      vehicles so avoid during busy periods as the queues can be very long! The
      ferry stops running after 10pm, so its advisable to travel through the
      Docklands and use the Blackwall Tunnel instead.
Comparatively few people will actually drive into (or anywhere near) the centre
of London. The infamous M25 ring road did not earn its irreverent nicknames
"The Road To Hell" and "Britains biggest car park" for nothing. The road is
heavily congested at most times of the day, and is littered with automatically
variable speed limits which are enforced with speed cameras. Despite the
controversial "congestion charge", driving a car anywhere near the centre of
London remains a nightmare with crowded roads, impatient drivers and
extortionate parking charges (thats if you can find a space in the first
place, that is!). From Monday through Friday, parking in the City of London is
free after 18:30; after 13:30 on Saturday and all day Sunday. For totally free
street parking, try the area around Canada Water Underground Station (Zone 2).
Its also outside the Congestion Charge Zone. Opposite the huge Decathlon,
theres a residential area with no parking limitation. Further along theres
also free parking at the massive car park at the cinema area (near the 24 hour
Tesco Extra). There are also a number of Pay as you go car rental companies
operating around London including WhizzGo  and Car Clubs

London can be stressful with kids - check London_with_children for slightly
less stressful sightseeing

London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate
district articles and only an overview is presented here.
**** Landmarks *****
Tower Bridge behind the Girl and Dolphin sculpture
Buckingham Palace
London Eye
    * Buckingham Palace - The official London residence of the Queen, also in
      Westminster. Open for tours during the summer months only, but a must-see
      sight even if you dont go in.
    * The London Eye. The worlds third largest observation wheel, situated on
      the South_Bank of the Thames with magnificent views over London.
    * Marble Arch is a white Carrara marble monument designed by John Nash. It
      is located in the middle of a huge traffic island at one of the busiest
      intersections in central London where Oxford St meets Park Lane in
      Mayfair. It used to stand in front of Buckingham Palace, before it was
      moved to its present location.
    * Piccadilly_Circus is one of the most photographed sights in London. The
      statue of Eros stands proudly in the middle while the north eastern side
      is dominated by a huge, iconic neon sign.
    * St Pauls Cathedral, also in the_City, is Sir Christopher Wrens great
      accomplishment, built after the 1666 Great Fire of London - the great
      dome is still seated in majesty over The City. A section of the dome has
      such good acoustics that it forms a "Whispering Gallery".
    * Tower Bridge - Is the iconic 19th century bridge located by the Tower of
      London near the_City. It is decorated with high towers and featuring a
      drawbridge and you can visit the engine rooms and a Tower Bridge
      exhibition.
St Pauls Cathedral
    * Tower of London - Situated just south east of the_City, is Londons
      original royal fortress by the Thames. It is over 900 years old, contains
      the Crown Jewels, guarded by Beefeaters, and is a World_Heritage site. It
      is also considered by many to be the most haunted building in the world.
      If you are interested in that sort of thing its definitely somewhere
      worth visiting. Sometimes there are guided ghost walks of the building.
Trafalgar Square
    * Trafalgar_Square - Home of Nelsons Column and the lions, and once a safe
      haven for Londons pigeons until the recent introduction of hired birds
      of prey. It recently attracted controversy over the Fourth plinth,
      previously empty, being temporarily home to a Marc Quin sculpture,
      Alison Lapper Pregnant. Overlooked by the National Gallery, its the
      nearest London has to a centre, and has recently been pedestrianised.
      Classical music concerts at St Martin-in-the-Fields.
    * Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster (including Big Ben and
      the Houses of Parliament) in Westminster. The seat of the United Kingdom
      parliament and World_Heritage site, as well as setting for royal
      coronations since 1066, most recently that of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
      The Palace of Westminster is open to the public for viewing parliamentary
      debates, tours of the building are available during August-September when
      Parliament is away on summer recess and every Saturday throughout the
      year.
    * 30 St Mary Axe or The Gherkin, a peculiarly-shaped 180 m- (590 ft-
      ) building in the City, which provides a 360-degree view of London on the
      40th floor.
    * The Shard, a futuristic skyscraper that was topped-out in 2012 and
      dominates the London skyline. Its the tallest building in the EU at 310
      m (1,017 ft) and features a viewing deck on the 72nd floor.
**** Museums and Galleries *****
London hosts an outstanding collection of world-class museums. Even better, it
is the only one of the traditional "alpha world cities" (London, Tokyo, New
York_City and Paris) in which the majority of the museums have no entrance for
their ever shrinking permanent exhibitions, thus allowing visitors to make
multiple visits with ease. Although London can be expensive, many of the best
museums and galleries are partially free including:
    * British_Museum
    * National_Gallery
    * National_Portrait_Gallery
    * Victoria_and_Albert_Museum
    * Natural_History_Museum
    * Tate_Modern
    * Tate_Britain
and most museums in Greenwich. Sadly, admission to temporary exhibitions can
cost Â£10.00-Â£15.00, and many museums websites are quite vague about these
charges. Often museums will boast of free admission, which may be only for one
small room while the majority of the space requires a substantial entry fee.
Aside from these world famous establishments, there is an almost unbelievable
number of minor museums in London covering a very diverse range of subjects.
The British government lists over 240 genuine museums in the city.
**** Parks *****
St James Park
The green lungs of London are the many parks, great and small, scattered
throughout the city including Hyde_Park, St_James_Park and Regents_Park. Most
of the larger parks have their origins in royal estates and hunting grounds and
are still owned by the Crown, despite their public access.
    * Hyde_Park_and_adjoining_Kensington_Gardens make up a huge open space in
      central London and are very popular for picnics.
    * Regents_Park is wonderful open park in the northern part of central
      London.
    * St_Jamess_Park has charming and romantic gardens ideal for picnics and
      for strolling around. St. Jamess Park is situated between Buckingham
      Palace on the west and Horse Guards Parade on the east.
    * Hampstead_Heath is a huge open green space in north central London. Not a
      tended park as such and is remarkably wild for a metropolitan city
      location. The views from the Parliament Hill area of the heath south over
      the city are quite stunning.
    * Richmond Park also is a huge green space, but has a thriving deer
      population that is culled in the spring. Excellent place for cycling.
    * Holland Park is a large woodland located in the centre of London. It is a
      great place to go if you are after some peace and quiet. In the middle of
      the park is Kyoto gardens were you can buy food and drinks.
    * Bushy Park, near to Hampton Court Palace, is the second-largest park in
      London. More low-key than its larger cousin, Richmond Park, it too has a
      large deer population. Bushy Park contains numerous ponds, bridleways,
      two allotments, and at its northern edge, the National Physical
      Laboratory.
One of more than 800 Blue Plaques throughout London
**** Blue Plaques *****
English Heritage runs the Blue Plaques  programme in London. Blue Plaques
celebrate great figures of the past and the buildings that they inhabited.
These are among the most familiar features of the capitalâs streetscape and
adorn the faÃ§ades of buildings across the city. Since the first plaque was
erected in 1867, the number has grown steadily and there are now more than 800.
Recipients are as diverse as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Sigmund Freud, Charles de
Gaulle, Jimi Hendrix and Karl Marx. Look out for these around the city.
</blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Contact</h2><br />**** Wi-Fi access *****
London is unfortunately not noted for free public Wi-Fi access - although the
number of hotspots is continuing to grow. In general, good places to start
looking are coffee shops (usually free with a purchase, typically The Cloud -
or otherwise ask the person on the till if they have a local hotspot) and pubs,
since many offer free Wi-Fi to boost business.
    * O2 Free Hotspots, . . O2 is offering free Wi-Fi around Londons
      busiest streets including parts of Oxford- and Regents Street. Click on
      the link to see the map. Free. Â  *
    * Online-4-Free.com, . One of the most promising (it seems) for
      traveller-frequented areas, a service that provides blanket coverage
      along the banks of the River Thames (and some surrounding streets) from
      Millbank down to Greenwich Pier, and a small cloud in Holborn - the
      free service asks only that you view a short advertisement every half
      hour in order to get 256 kbps (higher rates and ad-free come at a small
      charge). Free. Â  *
    * Tate Modern, . Offering for a trial period free Wi-Fi internet
      access. Â  *
    * British Library, . Offers free internet access throughout the library
      with registration. Â  *
    * Royal Festival Hall at Southbank Centre, . Offers free unencrypted
      Wi-Fi throughout the building without registration. Â  *
Another good place for free Wi-Fi would be McDonalds, where free 24-hour
period Wi-Fi are offered to customers. Starbucks offers free Wi-Fi for
customers registering their prepaid Starbucks Card. Furthermore, Pret-A-Manger
franchises offer free internet without a login. A number of shops around Oxford
Street are also beginning to offer free Wi-Fi, handy whilst you wait.
**** Mobile/cellular networks *****
The main mobile networks are EE, Vodafone, Three and O2. However there are a
host of MVNOs that use the infrastructure of these networks, these often offer
plans tailored towards expat communities and tourist who wish to call abroad,
the main players are LycaMobile, Lebara and giffgaff. If staying connected is a
priority you may want to compare the data speeds of the networks, OpenSignal
provide London_coverage_maps.
</blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Districts</h2><br />Tower Bridge at night, bridging the River Thames.
The name London originally referred only to the once-walled "Square Mile" of
the original Roman (and later medieval) city (confusingly called the "City_of
London" or just "The City"). Today, London has taken on a much larger meaning
to include all of the vast central parts of the modern metropolis, with the
city having absorbed numerous surrounding towns and villages over the
centuries, including large portions of the surrounding "home counties", one of
which - Middlesex - being completely consumed by the growing metropolis. The
term "Central London" is widely used on both signs and by the media to decribe
the downtown area of the city, which encompasses The City, most of the City of
Westminster, and some of the surrounding boroughs. The term "Greater London"
embraces Central London together with all the outlying suburbs that lie in one
continuous urban sprawl within the lower Thames valley. Though densely
populated by New World standards, London retains large swathes of green
parkland and open space, even within the city centre.
Greater London consists of 32 London boroughs and the City of London that,
together with the office of the Mayor of London, form the basis for Londons
local government. The Mayor of London is elected by London residents and should
not be confused with the Lord Mayor of the City of London. The names of several
boroughs, such as Westminster or Camden, are well-known, others less so, such
as Wandsworth or Lewisham. This travellers guide to London recognises
cultural, functional and social districts of varying type and size:

</blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Understand</h2><br />The Tower of London
      "When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in
      London all that life can afford" â Samuel Johnson
**** History *****
Settlement has existed on the site of London since well before Roman times,
with evidence of Bronze Age and Celtic settlement. The Roman city of Londinium,
established just after the Roman conquest of Britannia in the year 43, formed
the basis for the modern city (some isolated Roman period remains are still to
be seen within the City). After the end of Roman rule in 410 and a short-lived
decline, London experienced a gradual revival under the Anglo-Saxons, as well
as the Norsemen, and emerged as a great medieval trading city, and eventually
replaced Winchester as the royal capital of England. This paramount status for
London was confirmed when William the Conqueror, a Norman, built the Tower_of
London after the conquest in 1066 and was crowned King of England in
Westminster.
London went from strength to strength and with the rise of England to first
European then global prominence the city became a great centre of culture,
government and industry. Londons long association with the theatre, for
example, can be traced back to the English renaissance (witness the Rose
Theatre and great playwrights like Shakespeare who made London their home).
With the rise of Britain to supreme maritime power in the 18th and 19th
centuries and the possessor of the largest global empire, London became an
imperial capital and drew people and influences from around the world to
become, for many years, the largest city in the world.
The Royal families over the previous centuries, added much to the London scene
for todays traveller: the Albert_Memorial, Buckingham_Palace, Kensington
Palace, Royal_Albert_Hall, Tower_of_London, Kew_Palace and Westminster_Abbey
being prominent examples.
Despite the inevitable decline of the British Empire, and considerable
suffering during World War II (when London was heavily bombed by the German
Luftwaffe in the Blitz), the city is still a top-ranked world city: a global
centre of culture, finance, and learning. Today London is easily the largest
city in the United Kingdom, eight times larger than the second largest,
Birmingham, and ten times larger than the third, Glasgow, and dominates the
economic, political and social life of the nation. It is full of excellent
bars, galleries, museums, parks and theatres. It is also the most culturally
and ethnically diverse part of the country, making it a great multicultural
city to visit. Samuel Johnson famously said, "when one is tired of London, one
is tired of life." Whether you are interested in ancient history, modern art,
opera or underground raves, London has it all.
**** The_City and Westminster *****
The world famous Elizabeth Tower (which houses the bell named Big Ben)
If you ask a Londoner where the centre of London is, you are likely to get a
wry smile. This is because historically London was two cities: a commercial
city and a separate government capital.
However, the point from which distances to "London" are measured is in
Trafalgar Square, where the original Charing Cross stood.
The commercial capital was the City_of_London. This had a dense population and
all the other pre-requisites of a medieval city: walls, a castle (The Tower of
London), a cathedral (Saint Pauls), a semi-independent City government, a port
and a bridge across which all trade was routed so Londoners could make money
(London Bridge).
About an hour upstream (on foot or by boat) around a bend in the river was the
government capital (Westminster). This had a church for crowning the monarch
(Westminster Abbey) and palaces. As each palace was replaced by a larger one,
the previous one was used for government, first the Palace of Westminster
(better known as the Houses of Parliament), then Whitehall, then Buckingham
Palace. The two were linked by a road called "The Strand", old English for
riverbank.
London grew both west and east. The land to the west of the City (part of the
parish of Westminster) was prime farming land (Covent_Garden and Soho for
example) and made good building land. The land to the east was flat, marshy and
cheap, good for cheap housing and industry, and later for docks. Also the wind
blows 3 days out of 4 from west to east, and the Thames (into which the sewage
went) flows from west to east. So the West_End was up-wind and up-market, the
East_End (as well as further down river and beyond) was where the citys heavy
industries were based, and thus became the epicentre of the working classes.
Modern-day London in these terms is a two-centre city, with the area in between
known confusingly as the West End. However, even this doesnt define the actual
central area of London, which extends slightly beyond the City and Westminster,
as inner portions of the surrounding boroughs (Kensington &amp; Chelsea,
Camden, Islington, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark and Lambeth) also lie
within Central London.

See the 5 day forecast for London at the Met_Office
London Eye
Despite a perhaps unfair reputation for being unsettled, London enjoys a drier
and milder climate than the rest of Britain on average. Only one in three days
on average will bring rain and often only for a short period. In some years,
such as 2010, there was no rain for several weeks.
Winter in London is mild compared to nearby continental European cities, due to
both the presence of the Gulf Stream and urban heat effect. Average daily
maximum is 8Â°C (46Â°F) in December and January. Snow does occur, usually a few
times a year but rarely heavy (a few years being exceptions such as the winters
of 2009 and 2010, with temperatures dipping down to sub-zeros regularly). Snow
in London can be crippling, as seen at the end of 2010. Just 7cm (3Â in) of
snow will cause trains to stop running, airports to see significant delays, and
mail service will halt. London is a city which does not cope well with snow;
walkways, stairs, and streets will not be cleared by shovels or ploughs. The
streets will be salted/gritted, but will remain slick and snow/slush covered
until the sun melts it away. Daylight hours are short with darkness filling up
the sky by 4pm in December.
Summer is perhaps the best season for tourists as it has long daylight hours as
well as mild temperatures. The average daily high temperatures in July and
August are around 24Â°C (75Â°F) The highest temperature since 2000 was recorded
once in August at 38Â°C (100Â°F). This means London can feel hot and humid for
several days in the summer months. Also, because of urban heat effect, during
night time it could feel muggy.
Regardless of which time of the year, the weather in London could change
quickly from sunny to rain and from hot to cold.
**** Tourist Information Centres *****
London has no single primary tourist information centre, after the closure of
the Britain and London Visitor Centre in December 2011. Visit Britain now only
exists on-line.
Londons own visitor promotion body is known as London and Partners and also
has no public office, but maintains the website Visit_London.
The Millennium Bridge leading to St Pauls Cathedral
The only tourist information centre in zone 1 is the City of London Information
Centre, St Pauls Churchyard, EC4M 8BX. Officially the tourist information
centre for the City of London, it became the tourist office for Central London
by default when everything else closed. Open daily Monday-Saturday 09:30-17:30
(9:30am to 5:30pm), Sunday 10:00-16:00. Closed Dec 25-26.
There is also a tourist information centre in Greenwich, near the Cutty Sark,
in the same building as Discover Greenwich.

**** Crime *****
Like many big cities, London has a variety of social problems, especially
begging, drug abuse and theft (mobile phones are a favourite, often snatched by
fast-moving cyclists).
London has the oldest police force in the world, The Metropolitan Police
Service , and on the whole, London is a safe place to visit and explore.
Alongside the regular Police, there are over 4,000 Police Community Support
Officers (PCSOs) that provide a highly visible presence on the streets and are
able to deal with low-level crime. Normal precautions for the safe keeping of
your personal possessions, as you would in any other city, are suggested.
Crime mapping has been launched in London allowing residents and visitors to
see the level of recorded crime for different areas .
If youre planning to go out late at night and are worried about safety,
frequent crowded areas such as the West End. There are always plenty of people
on the street, even at 4AM. Generally, outside central London, the South, and
East suburban areas are considered more dangerous, notably Brixton, Peckham and
Hackney, although some parts of North-West London such as Harlesden and
northern_Camden are also known trouble spots. While muggings are rare, they do
happen. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you find yourself
on a lightly traveled or poorly lit street.
The main problem right throughout London to various degrees is drunken
behaviour, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights and after football
matches. Loud and rowdy behaviour is to be expected and fights and acts of
aggression also occur. If you are harassed, it is best to simply ignore and
walk away from those concerned. Trouble spots can be expected around popular
drinking locations such as Soho and in various suburban centres.
Every night, Soho presents a particular danger: the "clip joint". The usual
targets of these establishments are lone male tourists. Usually, an attractive
woman will casually befriend the victim and recommend a local bar or even a
club that has a "show". The establishment will be near-desolate, and, even if
the victim has only a drink or two, the bill will run to hundreds of pounds. If
payment is not immediately provided, the bouncers will lock the "patrons"
inside and take it by force or take them to an ATM and stand over them while
they extract the cash.
To be safe, if a woman you just met suggests you a place, try to recommend a
different bar. If she insists on hers then walk away and do not listen to her
suggestions. Sometimes this con trick takes place when someone is lured into a
private club with the promise of something perhaps more than a drink (like a
private show or sex for a small amount of money). A hostess fee will appear
on the bill for several hundred pounds, even though there has been nothing more
than polite conversation.
The Metropolitan Police have placed significant resources in combating street
level crime. Working in conjunction with borough councils, they have been able
to bring the level of theft and pickpocketing in major retail areas in London
to a level that is manageable. A particular problem is snatch thefts,
typically of mobile phones. Be careful using a smartphone as you get off the
tube, or in subways.
Street gang culture is a growing problem in London as with many other cities in
England. While most groups of youngsters are not likely to present any danger
to tourists, some people feel the need to be slightly more vigilant in certain
areas, especially certain outer suburbs.
Stereotypically the East End and the Southeast of London have long been seen as
hotbeds of crime Firms, a term given to organized criminal groups from the
mostly White British working class. Nowadays the presence of those groups has
greatly diminished but still exists in said territories and sightings of shady
figures are not uncommon, especially in local pubs and businesses. The pose no
threat to tourists however and wont bother you if left alone.
If anyone offers you a free "stress test", they are likely trying to recruit
you into the Church of Scientology. The best option is to walk away or just say
"No thank you" politely, as people are commonly harassed into giving personal
details.
Scams/Con Artists London has a large number of con artists around, all trying
to convince you to hand over your hard-earned money one way or another. In a
well-known scam, an older gentleman will ask you for directions, convincing you
that he thought you were English. This scam has been used for over ten years.
Other popular scams are a man in a suit asking for emergency money for the
phone (seen in Shor *ch many times). Also a man with a very convincing fake
gash on his arm - asking for money to get to hospital (strangely refusing the
offer of calling an ambulance).
One of the_most_popular_scams_in_London, is the ticket_machine_scam, when,
while buying a ticket at a train station someone will approach you and act as
if they want to help you buy the right ticket. In reality they will wait until
your money is in the machine, then lean across, cancel the transaction and
pocket your cash.
**** Transport *****
Dont take illegal minicabs (see Get around for details).
Travelling on lower deck of a night bus is generally safer, as there are more
passengers around, and you are visible by the bus driver.
If you have been the victim of crime on the railways or the London Underground,
you should report the crime as soon as possible to the British Transport
Police, who have an office in most major train and tube stations. Elsewhere,
you should report your crime as normal to the Metropolitan Police. Non-
emergency calls to the police should be made on 101.
</blockquote> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><h2>Eat</h2><br />This guide uses the following price ranges for a typical meal for one,
including soft drink:
Budget    Below Â£15
Mid-range Â£15-50
Splurge   Â£50+
Smoking Ban
Smoking is banned in all UK pubs and restaurants.

It is a huge task for a visitor to find the right place to eat in London -
with the right atmosphere, at the right price - largely because, as in any
big city, there are literally thousands of venues from which to choose, ranging
from fast food joints, pubs, and mainstream chains all the way up to some of
the most exclusive restaurants in the world which attract the kind of clientele
that dont need to ask the price. Sorting the good from the bad isnt easy, but
London has something to accommodate all budgets and tastes. Following is a
rough guide to what you might get, should you fancy eating out:
    * Up to Â£5 - you can get a good English pub or cafeteria breakfast with a
      rack of bacon, beans in tomato sauce, egg, sausage, orange juice and
      coffee or tea. Most pubs stop this offer at 11:00, but there are
      literally hundreds of backstreet cafes (collquially known as "greasy
      spoons") which will serve this sort of food all day.
    * Â£7 - will buy you a couple of sandwiches and a soft drink, some takeaway
      fish and chips, or a fast food meal. There are also a number of mostly
      Chinese restaurants which serve an all you can eat buffet for around this
      price. These are dotted about the West End and it is well worth asking a
      member of public or a shopkeeper where the nearest one is. These
      restaurants make much of their revenue on drinks although these are
      usually still moderately priced. The food whilst not being of the finest
      standard is usually very tasty and the range of dishes available is
      excellent. There are literally thousands of so called takeaways in London
      and a cheap alternative to a restaurant meal. Check with your hotel
      management if they allow food deliveries before ordering in. Most
      takeaways will offer some form of seating, but not all do.
    * Â£6-10 - will get you a good pub meal and drink or a good Chinese/Indian/
      Italian/Thai/Vietnamese buffet. Be aware that many pubs have a buy-one-
      get-one-free offer, and you can either order two main dishes for yourself
      or bring a friend.
    * Â£15 - some more expensive French, M *erranean and international
      restaurants do cheaper two or three course lunch menus.
    * Â£25 - offers you a lot more choice. You can have a good meal, half a
      bottle of wine and change for the tube home. There are plenty of modest
      restaurants that cater for this bracket.
    * Â£50 (to almost any amount!) - with more money to spend you can pick some
      of the citys finer restaurants. It may be a famous chef (like Michel
      Roux, Jr or Gordon Ramsay) or simply a place that prides itself on using
      the finest ingredients. Worth the splurge to impress a special someone.
      Note that these establishments often need to be booked well in advance,
      and most will enforce a dress code of some sort, like Rules of Covent
      Garden, the oldest resturant still extant.
Prices inevitably become inflated at venues closest to major tourist
attractions - beware the so-called tourist traps. The worst tourist trap food
is, in the opinion of many Londoners, is served at the various steak houses
(Angus Steak House, Aberdeen Steak House etc - they are all dotted around the
West End and near to the main train stations). Londoners wouldnt dream of
eating here - you shouldnt either! Notorious areas for inflated menu prices
trading on travellers lack of knowledge are the streets around the British
Museum, Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus. Even the major fast food chains
charge a premium in their West End outlets - so watch out.
Pubs within the touristy areas of London are usually a poor choice for food
although there are some brilliant gastro-pubs hidden away - use the internet
or a good guide (such as Time Out or Datemojo) to find them. In general avoid
all pubs that have graphic-designed and printed menus - its peoples
experiences in these kind of places that gives Britain a bad name for food!
Look around you - see any locals tucking in? No? - then you shouldnt either.
The other rule to follow when avoiding poor food is the same as in any other
part of Europe - is the menu available in multiple languages? If yes then start
running!!
In the suburbs, the cost of eating out is reduced drastically. Particularly in
large ethnic communities, there is a competitive market which stands to benefit
the consumer. In East London for example, the vast number of chicken shops
means that a deal for 2 pieces of chicken, chips (fries) and a drink shouldnt
cost you more than Â£3 especially on Brick Lane. Another good (and cheap) lunch
option is a chicken or lamb doner (gyro) at many outlets throughout the city,
though meat quality is often poor.
For more authentic Cockney food, try pie and mash, which originates from the
working-class in the East End. Usually minced beef and cold water pastry
pie served with mashed potato, mushy peas and liquour gravy, it tastes a lot
better then it sounds. Some of the best pie houses are M. Manze in Peckham or
F. Cooke in Hackney Broadway Market. Water Souchet and London Particular
(green-pea and ham) are classic Cockney soups, though hard to find on menus.
For those game, jellied eels, pickled-cockles and whelks are all traditional
London seafood. For cheap, quality fish and chips frequented by many black
cab drivers, try Super Fish near Waterloo station.
Tipping may also be different than what youre used to. All meals include the
20% VAT tax and some places include a service fee (10-12%). The general rule is
to leave a tip for table service, unless theres already a service charge added
or unless the service has been notably poor. The amount tipped is generally in
the region of 10%, but if theres a figure between 10 and 15% which would leave
the bill at a conveniently round total, many would consider it polite to tip
this amount. Tipping for counter service, or any other form of service, is
unusual - but some choose to do so if a tips container is provided.
**** Restaurant Streets *****
Many Londoners, especially in the evenings, eat out in their local neighborhood
or a nearby restaurant hub, rather than eating in central London. The reasons
are simple; the the quality of the food will be better, the quality of the
service is better, and the cost is significantly lower. Generally in zones 2-
6 you will get a much more pleasant, better value, and less crowded eating
experience than you will find in the West End. The suburbs are home to many
independent restaurants that keep standards high in order to attach repeat
custom. Even the chain restaurants tend to be better outside zone 1 serving
identical menus to their West End outlets but without tourist premiums being
added to the prices.
Restaurant streets are best visited in the evenings as many places are closed
or very quiet during the day.
European / British Cuisine
    * Upper Street - Head to Highbury &amp; Islington (Victoria line) or Angel
      (Northern line). Dozens of excellent restaurants, popular with young
      professionals.
    * Stoke Newington Church Street - has a fantastic range of independent
      restaurants and cafes. Stoke Newington Rail Station or the 73 bus.
    * Charlotte Street in Fitzrovia has a wide range of chain and independent
      restaurants covering all cuisines. It is particularly popular with
      workers in the media industry, especially during weekday lunchtimes.
      Goodge Street Tube
    * Clapham Junction is not just a train station (lots of quick trains from
      Victoria and Waterloo) - but also home to many good restaurants and bars,
      in three clusters, all within 10 minutes walk of the station: Northcote
      Road / Battersea Rise, Lavender Hill, and St Johns Hill
    * Lordship Lane in the southern suburbs - head to East Dulwich station - a
      good selection of European restaurants and a few award winning gastropubs
    * Kings_Street extends on to Chiswick High Road from Hammersmith Tube
      Station and is one long road of a choice of restaurants at very
      reasonable prices, some bargain mentions are the Thai restaurants
      offering 2 course lunch for Â£7. Nearby Shepherds bush is about a 15min
      walk and is alive with bars and pubs in the evening.
    * South End, Croydon Croydon is derided by most Londoners as the end of the
      earth, however this suburban gem of a road has at least 30 decent
      restaurants, including three Argentinians, a Peruvian, a fish restaurant,
      and a couple of fancy modern European brassieres. Sadly chain restaurants
      are moving in (Zizzis, Pizza Express) but most of the places are still
      independent. Get a quick train to East Croydon station from Victoria or
      London Bridge (or South Croydon station, slower but nearer).
East Asian, South Asian, Middle-Eastern, Caribbean, and other
As one of the worlds most cosmopolitan cities, you can find restaurants
serving food cuisine from nearly every country, some of it as good as, if not
better than in the countries of origin. Indian food in London is especially
famous and there is hardly a district without at least one notable Indian
restaurant.
If you are looking for other particular regional foods these tend to be
clustered in certain areas and some examples are:
    * Brick_Lane in the_East_End is famous for Bangladeshi curries. Aldgate
      East or Shor *ch High Street tube stations.
    * Brixton for African/Caribbean. Brixton tube.
    * Drummond Street (just behind Euston railway station in the London/Camden
      district) has a fine mix of Indian / vegetarian restaurants - a short
      walk from Euston railway station.
    * Chinatown just off Leicester_Square for Chinese.
    * Edgware Road in Marylebone and Paddington is popular for Middle Eastern
      cuisine.
    * Golders_Green for Jewish fare.
    * Kingsland_Road for good cheap Vietnamese.
    * Finsbury_Park and nearby areas for Greek and Turkish.
    * Tooting, East Ham, Wembley and Southall for authentic &amp; cheap Indian
      eateries including authentic South Indian restaurants serving hot pongal,
      dosas, idlis and other South Indian "tiffin" items.
    * New Malden in south west London (zone 4) for Korean food.
Other nationalities are equally represented and randomly dotted all over
London. It is usually wisest to eat in restaurants on main thoroughfares rather
than on quiet backstreets.
**** Chains *****
Like other capitals in the world, London has the usual array of fast food
outlets. Sandwich shops are the most popular places to buy lunch, and there are
a lot of places to choose from including Eat and Pret a Manger. Some Italian-
style sandwich shops have a very good reputation and you can identify them
easily by looking at the long queues at lunchtime. If all else fails, Central
London has lots of mini-supermarkets operated by the big British supermarket
chains (e.g. , Sainsburys, Tesco) where you can pick up a pre-packed sandwich.
Fast food with an Asian flair is easy to find throughout the city, with lots of
Busaba Eathai, Wagamama, and Yo! Sushi locations throughout the city. Nandos
has spicy peri peri style grilled chicken.
**** Vegetarian *****
London has plenty of vegetarian-only restaurants many of them championing
organic foodstuffs, and a quick search in Google will produce plenty of ideas,
so you never have to see a piece of cooked meat all week.
If you are dining with carnivorous friends most restaurants will cater for
vegetarians and will have at least a couple of dishes on the menu. Indian/
Bangladeshi restaurants are generally fruitful, as they have plenty of
traditional dishes (good Indian/Bangladeshi options can be found in the Brick
Lane area of Spitalfields or further afeild in East Ham, Tooting Broadway and
Southall. These also tend to be very cheap eats with authentically prepared
dishes with a true local ambience). There are also many vegetarian Thai buffet
places where you can eat fake meat in tooth-achingly sweet sauces for under
Â£5. These can be found on Greek and Old Compton Sts in Soho and Islington_High
Street.
**** Religious *****
Due to the mix of cultures and religions, many London restaurants cater well
for religious dietary requirements. The most common signs are for Halal and
Kosher meat, from burger joints to nice restaurants. There are lots of Halal
restaurants  and shops all over London including Whitechapel Rd and Brick
Lane in the_East_End, Bayswater,_Edgware_Rd_and_Paddington and in many parts of
north_London. There are plenty of Kosher restaurants in Golders_Green, Edgware
and Stamford_Hill along with some central delis such as on Charing Cross Road.
There is also Hare Khrisna vegan resturant just off Charing X in Soho Square.
**** Convenience stores and supermarkets *****
Convenience stores such as Tesco Metro, Sainsbury Central/Local, Budgens,
Costcutter, SPAR, Cooperative as well as privately-run corner shops sell pre-
made sandwiches, snacks, alcohol, cigarettes, drinks etc. Most are open from
05:00-23:00 (5 AM-11 PM) although some such as Tesco Metro or convenience
stores located at petrol stations may open 24 hours although they will stop
selling alcohol after 23:00 (11 PM). Be aware that Whistlestop convenience
stores (located in or around train stations) are notoriously overpriced and
should be avoided. If using a petrol-station convenience store late at night
(i.e. after 23:00/11 PM) the store will be locked and you should order and pay
through the external service window.
Full-size superstores such as Tesco, Asda and Morrisons are rare in the city
centre and usually require a 15-20 min tube ride to reach them. One of the
closest is the ASDA store close to Crossharbour DLR Station on the Lewisham
line - about 15-minute ride from Bank Station or at the end of the 135 24-hour
bus line. There is also a Tesco in the Surrey Quays shopping mall which is next
to Canada Water station on the Jubilee line - again about 10-15 minutes from
the centre of town. If you plan on buying lots of groceries its worth the trip
as prices are much lower than in any downtown supermarkets.
