Travel sites like TripAdvisor and others, although very useful for user reviews and expert content, have recently become dated in light of the lightning speed social based update. Many base their travel decisions not on the opinions of experts and strangers, but rather of their ``internet friends'' and people who they are not in immediate proximity with. This is a significant shortcoming of the current solution, as there can be just so many either experts or strangers who post dedicated reviews of travel locations in a city with the intent of strangers reading them. However, people on social media are very engaged with their traveling and often share their adventures (sometimes excessively!) with their friends and followers. The lack of current solutions for social travel planning is motivating for us to pursue this project.
