We aim to make the information gathering more fluid and current, as using the various channels, which people have come to rely on. By integrating unconventional sources of information, like Twitter, Search API, Weather, we aim to make a userâ€™s travel planning process seamless and integrated. This is as opposed to the current solutions of generally offering paid plans for hotels or otherwise giving the user high quality but very limited expert advice from forums.

We will gather information dynamically, including the period weather of particular city, most recent people's idea about the city retrieved from facebook or twitter. Food will also be gathered dynamically, maybe top 10 from YELP. So that users are able to pick up their vacation destination  by the information provided here. 

We receive significant validation from the existence of similar sites, such as \url{http://www.yeti.ai} - offering a similar service. We hope to distinguish ourselves from them by offering a web application, which we believe is more suitable for the purpose of research than a mobile application (less people do research on a phone when preparing for a vacation)
