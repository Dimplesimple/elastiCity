We aim to create a social travel planning workflow service, in what we believe is a novel change to the current process. Using Elasticsearch, a simple web scraper, and a user facing UI, we aim to create a tool to allow users to perform open ended queries against our corpus. We will build the corpus by retrieving information from travel sites and we will dynamically expand it by getting information from social media (what users currently say about a city).
If a city is not present in our corpus, we will have to retrieve information on-demand, combine the results and reply back to the user. At this point we can update our corpus to include the information we got and reply faster at  the next requests. Information like weather, local events, social updates, should always be retrieved periodically, or on-demand, since they change frequently.

By mining relevant data from social media and combining it with search, we can make search easier and more relevant - a user is much more likely (we expect) to make a travel related decision when somebody they follow (maybe even a celebrity) had talked about doing that same activity.
