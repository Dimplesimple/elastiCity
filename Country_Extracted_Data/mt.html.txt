Malta



  Background:
  Great Britain formally acquired possession of Malta in 1814. The island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars and remained in the Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964; a decade later it declared itself a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a financial
  center, and a tourist destination. Malta became an EU member in May 2004 and began using the euro as currency in 2008.
